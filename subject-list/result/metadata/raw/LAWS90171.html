The rising importance of big data, algorithmic decision-making, and online platforms create complex regulatory challenges for ensuring that the digital markets increase welfare. Competition law has an important role to play in this digital eco-system. Accordingly, this subject explores the complex challenges that digital markets pose to competition law. To do so, this subject will first analyze the unique characteristics of the digital environment and how they affect market dynamics.  It will then analyze the main challenges to competition law, including coordination through algorithmic interactions, market power based on big data, abusive conduct by platforms and intermediaries, and defining markets and market power in digital eco-systems. It will also explore the intersection between competition, consumer protection and privacy, which is raising important institutional questions for the allocation and coordination of regulatory responses.  This subject will explore global developments in this complex and fast-moving field. Drawing on the latest literature and major cases and inquiries, it will equip students to critically engage with and meet the challenges posed for business and its advisors and for policymakers, regulators and law enforcers in digital markets.  </p>
<p>This subject is led by two of the world’s competition law experts, with particular expertise in the regulation of digital markets.</p>
<p>Principal topics will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analysing the special characteristics of digital markets and the unique market dynamics they create, including:</li>
<li>Defining Big Data</li>
<li>Analysing the dynamics of Big Data markets, including entry barriers and network effects</li>
<li>Exploring advancements in algorithmic decision-making, including machine learning and deep learning</li>
<li>Debating the competitive significance of algorithmic decision-making based on Big Data</li>
<li>Exploring the role of digital intermediaries, including platforms, in the digital eco-system</li>
<li>Analysing the unique challenges that digital markets pose to competition law enforcement, including:</li>
<li>Increased coordination through algorithmic interactions</li>
<li>Market power based on big data</li>
<li>Abusive conduct by platforms and intermediaries</li>
<li>Defining markets and market power in digital eco-systems</li>
<li>Big Data and merger review</li>
<li>Challenges created by the bundling of different products and services in the digital eco-system</li>
<li>Analysing the intersection between competition, consumer protection and privacy</li>
</ul><div id="learning-outcomes"><h2>Intended learning outcomes</h2><p>On successful completion of this subject, students will:</p>
