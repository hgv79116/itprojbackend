<p>This unit requires the students to undertake a major design task utilising the knowledge gained throughout the Biochemical engineering course. This comprises the following tasks: design of a process to meet a specified requirement; feasibility study of alternative processes which meet the specification; determination of sequence for investigation of a chemical manufacturing project and preparation of a report; consideration of environmental impacts and sustainability issues; preparation of flowsheets; confirmation of effects of market forecasts; economic evaluation; preparation of estimates for the minimisation of capital and production costs; specification of equipment; selection of construction materials; and specification of instrumentation location, staff and labour requirements and safety precautions. The HYSYS simulation package will be utilised where appropriate. There will also be a series of lectures on various aspects of design.</p>
<p>This subject forms the major capstone design project for the Chemical engineering Discipline and closely simulates the design procedures the graduate students will undertake in chemical industry process and design engineers. The pre-requisites ensure that the students bring together all of the undergraduate knowledge and skills imparted in earlier years of the degree program. All aspects of the safe and environmentally responsible design of a chemical process plant are covered in this unit through project based learning. Through a careful sequential approach, the students develop a feasibility study, an initial process scoping and development report, and finally, a detailed design report. Team work is emphasized throughout to mimic the typical team environment the students will encounter in the work place.</p>
<p><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT</strong></p>
<p>No new topics of a technical nature are introduced into this unit. The unit requires the students to integrate their skills and knowledge from earlier units into a single, design project executed in a team environment. The content therefore includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A feasibility study which includes market analysis, plant location and health and safety assessment and preliminary economic evaluation of the proposal</li>
<li>A process development report which includes the assessment of technology options to produce the required product, a mass and energy balance of the proposed process, as evaluation of the environmental impact of the process, a safety analysis, and a detailed process flow diagram of the proposed process</li>
<li>A detailed design report including the detailed process and mechanical design of a unit operation with the process, the full process control and operation as well as process and instrumentation diagram of the process, specification of all minor equipment items in the process, a full HAZOP of a section of the plant, a full economic analysis and sensitivity study of the proposed plant.</li>
</ul>
<p>This subject has been integrated with the Skills Towards Employment Program (STEP) and contains activities that can assist in the completion of the Engineering Practice Hurdle (EPH).</p><div id="learning-outcomes"><h2>Intended learning outcomes</h2><p>On completion of this subject the student is expected to:</p><ul class="ticked-list"><li id="LO1">Complete a chemical engineering feasibility study for a proposed product/process</li><li id="LO2">Conduct a process development assessment and mass and energy balances to determine the overall scope and intent of the project</li><li id="LO3">Carry out the integrated process and equipment design for an industrial chemical process, which is initially poorly-defined and for which much of the design data is not available</li><li id="LO4">Function as part of a team and manage their time effectively</li><li id="LO5">Apply all of the hard and soft skills acquired in earlier units in an integrated way to develop a full chemical plant design package</li></ul></div><div id="generic-skills"><h2>Generic skills</h2><ul class="ticked-list">

<p>The subject is developed through team work and through a series of lectures, guest speakers, and weekly consultancy sessions. The deliverables in the project are managed carefully and teams are expected to meet deadlines as required during the unit. The consultancy sessions include meetings with industry engineers to provide real-work input into the students design and decision making process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>INDICATIVE KEY LEARNING RESOURCES</strong></p>
<p>Prior to the start of this unit, a substantial database of technical reports, journal articles, web sites and patents is set up. These are all relevant to the particular chemical/biological process being evaluated. Students have access to this database through the subject LMS site upon the start of the project. In addition, lecture notes and weekly consultancy sessions with experienced engineers provide additional resources for their learning. All lecture notes, discussion, progress updates etc are communicated through the project LMS site.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>CAREERS / INDUSTRY LINKS</strong></p>
<p>The unit is run in close consultation with industry engineers both with respect to setting up the project as well as weekly consultancy sessions with industry engineers. Guest lecturers from industry are also invited to convey the industry relevance of the project undertaken.</p></div></li><li class="related accordion__visible"><div class="accordion__title">Related Handbook entries</div><div class="accordion__hidden"><p>This subject contributes to the following:</p><table class="zebra" data-sortable=""><thead><tr><th scope="col">Type</th><th scope="col">Name</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Specialisation (formal)</td><td><a href="/2024/components/mc-eng-spec-1">Biochemical</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></li><li class="community-access accordion__visible"><div class="accordion__title">Available through the Community Access Program</div><div class="accordion__hidden"><h3>About the Community Access Program (CAP)</h3><p>This subject is available through the <a href="https://futurestudents.unimelb.edu.au/courses/single_subject_studies">Community Access Program</a> (also called Single Subject Studies) which allows you to enrol in single subjects offered by the University of Melbourne, without the commitment required to complete a whole degree.</p><p>Entry requirements including prerequisites may apply.
