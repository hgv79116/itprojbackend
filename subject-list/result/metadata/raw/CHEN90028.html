<p>Students will receive one-on-one instruction on how to complete an open-ended research project on some industrially-related topic in chemical engineering. They will undertake a project either individually or as part of a team of two students. Students will take responsibility for their time management setting priorities and establishing a program that will allow them to complete their project within the time allowed. They will also need to be aware of and follow all safety procedures and rules on site.</p>
<p><strong>INDICATIVE KEY LEARNING RESOURCES</strong></p>
<p>Students will be guided throughout their project by an engineer of the industry project sponsor as well as by an academic of the Department. These engineers will be their guides and mentors on the project. Students will also be provided with access to key relevant research papers. They will be expected to identify further material which they will be able to access through the University Library system.</p>
<p><strong>CAREERS / INDUSTRY LINKS</strong></p>
<p>The projects available in this subject are all industry relevant. They may require the student to travel to the industry partner site. Students will be challenged with real projects that are of importance to industry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>RESEARCH-PATHWAY RELATED</strong></p>
<p>Some projects in CHEN90028 may qualify as a research pathway for entry to PhD studies. However, students possibly interested in PhD study are strongly recommended to take CHEN90023 Research Project or BIEN90001 Biochemical Engineering Research Project, as PhD entry requires at least 25 points of research to have been completed.</p></div></li><li class="related accordion__visible"><div class="accordion__title">Related Handbook entries</div><div class="accordion__hidden"><p>This subject contributes to the following:</p><table class="zebra" data-sortable=""><thead><tr><th scope="col">Type</th><th scope="col">Name</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Specialisation (formal)</td><td><a href="/2024/components/mc-eng-spec-1">Biochemical</a></td></tr><tr><td>Specialisation (formal)</td><td><a href="/2024/components/mc-eng-spec-4">Chemical</a></td></tr><tr><td>Specialisation (formal)</td><td><a href="/2024/components/mc-eng-spec-5">Chemical with Business</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></li><li class="community-access accordion__visible"><div class="accordion__title">Available through the Community Access Program</div><div class="accordion__hidden"><h3>About the Community Access Program (CAP)</h3><p>This subject is available through the <a href="https://futurestudents.unimelb.edu.au/courses/single_subject_studies">Community Access Program</a> (also called Single Subject Studies) which allows you to enrol in single subjects offered by the University of Melbourne, without the commitment required to complete a whole degree.</p><p>Entry requirements including prerequisites may apply.
