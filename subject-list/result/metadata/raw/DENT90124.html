Students will engage in tasks that will demonstrate and further enhance their skills preparing them for the work environment in which they will participate and contribute to, on graduation as a dentist.</p>
<p>This year-long subject is developed as a capstone experience with a practice based learning approach. The learning tasks will enhance students’ capacity to apply theoretical knowledge gained in previous years of the course to “real world” situations. Students will integrate graduate capabilities with clinical skills that are required to practice as an independent health care professional. They will also develop skills in teamwork and communication with the wider health sector. The clinical practice sessions, especially at the community health centres, will allow students to reflect on emotional and practical issues of transition from the university learning environment to the world of independent clinical practice. They also provide the opportunity to link students to future employers. The intended learning outcomes are designed to engender the development of graduate attributes.</p><div id="learning-outcomes"><h2>Intended learning outcomes</h2><p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="color: black;">On completion of this subject students should:</span></p><ul class="ticked-list"><li id="LO1">demonstrate appropriate caring behaviour towards patients and maintain professional relationships between themselves and patients;</li><li id="LO2">understand and apply the principles of culturally safe and sensitive practice and provide care in an empathic manner;</li><li id="LO3">demonstrate competence in managing oral health issues of rural, remote communities and Indigenous communities;</li><li id="LO4">be able to apply the ethical principles and legal responsibilities involved in the provision of dental care;</li><li id="LO5">be able to provide patient-centred care; maintain patient confidentiality, respect patients&#39; self-esteem and focus on the patient&#39;s best interests at all times;</li><li id="LO6">be able to practise evidence-based dentistry;</li><li id="LO7">use contemporary information technology for documentation, management of information and applications related to health care;</li><li id="LO8">have developed effective communication skills to gather necessary information from patients;</li><li id="LO9">be able to communicate well with other members of the dental team;</li><li id="LO10">be able to identify patients&#39; expectations, desires and attitudes when planning and providing treatment;</li><li id="LO11">be able to apply the scientific principles of sterilisation, disinfection and antisepsis, and cross infection control to clinical practice;</li><li id="LO12">understand and apply the regulations relating to the use of ionising radiation, including radiation protection and dose reduction;</li><li id="LO13">have developed skills in gathering relevant information (obtaining a complete history) and performing an appropriate examination (of soft and hard tissues) including appropriate special investigations;</li><li id="LO14">be able to synthesise the information collected in order to arrive at a diagnosis;</li><li id="LO15">demonstrate skills in formulating appropriate treatment plans to suit the patient (for simple and complex general dental conditions), be able to propose treatment options (based on sound oral health care philosophies) and discuss with the patient to arrive at the treatment of choice;</li><li id="LO16">demonstrate the process of accurate record keeping, and obtaining and recording informed consent for all forms of treatment;</li><li id="LO17">be able to manage periodontal disease, caries and loss of tooth structure due to other factors, manage pulp and peri-radicular disease and disorders, manage loss of teeth and related disabilities through provision of removable or fixed prostheses;</li><li id="LO18">be able to diagnose orofacial pain and TMD disorders and manage simple conditions;</li><li id="LO19">demonstrate the ability to diagnose and manage psychological and behavioural issues arising from dental conditions and also those behavioural factors that impact on dental treatment;</li><li id="LO20">have developed skills to safely perform a wide range of clinical procedures which are pertinent to general dental practice;</li><li id="LO21">recognise and know when to refer patients to specialists or to seek appropriate advice from specialists;</li><li id="LO22">be able to effectively engage in oral health promotion;</li><li id="LO23">engage in professional development activities.</li></ul></div><div id="generic-skills"><h2>Generic skills</h2><ul><li id="GS1">On completion of this subject students should have developed skills in the following:

<p>• observation;</p>
<p>• communication;</p>
<p>• motor;</p>
<p>• conceptual, integrative, and quantitative;</p>
<p>• behavioural and social.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I. Observation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Practical Classes</strong></p>
<p>The student must be able to observe mandatory demonstrations and experiments in the designated subjects.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Work</strong></p>
<p>The student must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand. Observation necessitates the functional use of the senses of vision, hearing and somatic sensation. It is enhanced by the functional use of the sense of smell.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>II. Communication:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Practical Classes</strong></p>
<p>The student must be able to hear and comprehend instructions in laboratories and practical sessions and be able to clearly and independently communicate knowledge and application of the principles and practices of the subject during assessment tasks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Work</strong></p>
<p>A student must be able to hear, to speak, and to observe patients in order to elicit information, describe changes in mood, activity, and posture and perceive nonverbal communications. A student must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients in both oral and written modalities. The student must also be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in both oral and written modes with all members of the health care team, including using telephones and computers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>III. Motor:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Practical Classes</strong></p>
<p>A student must be able to undertake the motor requirements for any mandatory practical sessions. Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium, and functional use of the senses of touch and vision.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Work</strong></p>
<p>Students should have good motor function to elicit information from patients by physical examination; for example palpation, percussion, and other diagnostic manoeuvres. Students should possess sufficient manual dexterity to be able to perform procedures required as a dental practitioner. The student should be able to execute motor movements reasonably required to provide general dental care and emergency treatment to patients. Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium, hand eye coordination and functional use of the senses of touch and vision.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Intellectual-Conceptual, Integrative and Quantitative Abilities:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Practical Classes</strong></p>
<p>The student is expected to have the ability to develop problem-solving skills and demonstrate this ability in practical sessions. These abilities include measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis, and synthesis. Problem solving requires all of these intellectual abilities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Work</strong></p>
<p>The student is expected to have the ability to develop problem-solving skills and demonstrate the ability to establish oral health care plans and priorities. These abilities include measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis, and synthesis. Problem solving requires all of these intellectual abilities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>V. Behavioural and Social Attributes:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Practical Classes</strong></p>
<p>A student must possess the emotional health required for full utilization of his/her intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgement, the prompt completion of all required tasks, and display professional behaviour at all times.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Work</strong></p>
<p>A student must possess the emotional health required for full utilization of his/her intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgement, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients. A student must display professional behaviour at all times and develop mature, sensitive, and effective relationships with patients and colleagues.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>It is a requirement of the course that students will be expected to physically examine their peers (of all genders) in teaching settings and patients (of all genders) in clinics.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The University is dedicated to provide support to those with special requirements. Further details can be found at the Student Equity and Disability Support website: <a href="http://www.services.unimelb.edu.au/disability/">http://www.services.unimelb.edu.au/disability/</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Melbourne Dental School policy outlining requirements in relation to student disability for entry to and progression within the DOCTOR OF DENTAL SURGERY are outlined below.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Melbourne Dental School Policy in Relation to Students with Disabilities</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The curriculum of the DOCTOR OF DENTAL SURGERY has been developed using 64 graduate attribute statements in six domains (professionalism, scientific knowledge, patient care, dental profession, systems of health care and the society). Students entering the Melbourne DOCTOR OF DENTAL SURGERY must therefore have the aptitude to achieve these attributes during the course in readiness for progression to independent practice.</p>
<p>The Melbourne Dental School welcomes applications from students with disabilities. It is University and Faculty policy to take all reasonable steps to minimise the impact of disability upon academic study. Appropriate adjustments will be made to enhance the participation of students with a disability in the dental course. A prospective student with a disability is advised to discuss with Student Equity and Disability Support any issues related to his or her ability to successfully meet all the course and subsequent registration requirements.</p>
<p>All students of the DOCTOR OF DENTAL SURGERY must possess the intellectual, ethical, physical and emotional capabilities required to participate in the full curriculum and to achieve the levels of competence at graduation required by the faculty and the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation agency.</p>
<p>A student with a disability may be asked to provide independent medical or other clinical assessments of the disability and its possible impact on the ability of the student to successfully complete the course, before being accepted into the course. This statement would be treated in confidence with only those on the admissions committee and the Student Equity and Disability Support having access to the document.</p>
<p>Deliberate misinformation about the student’s ability to successfully complete the course will be regarded as unprofessional practice and treated as such.</p>
<p>While the Melbourne Dental School will make reasonable adjustments to minimise the impact of a disability, all students must be able to participate in the program in an independent manner. It is not reasonable for students to use an intermediary as an adjustment to compensate for a disability impacting on any of the five categories. In the clinical environment there is a primary duty of care to the patients and the needs of students cannot compromise this. It is expected that all students will be able to participate fully in all classroom based learning activities and to successfully fulfil the self-study requirements of the course. The presence of a disability will not automatically entitle the student to preferential treatment in clinical place allocation.</p><p class="last-updated">Last updated: 7 August 2024</p><h2>Assessment</h2><div class="assessment-table"><table class="assessment-details"><thead><tr><th>Description</th><th>Timing</th><th>Percentage</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p> 1 x case-based short answer written examination (2000 word count equivalence)</p><ul><li>2 hours</li></ul></td><td> Mid-Year</td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td><p> Rural Placement Presentation and Report </p><ul><li>1000 words (equivalent)</li></ul></td><td>At the end of the rural rotation </td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td><p> Oral Exam (Viva Voce)- of an unknown patient (3000 word count equivalence)</p><ul><li>30 minutes</li></ul></td><td>End of the first half of year teaching period </td><td>15%</td></tr><tr><td><p> Case presentation of a known patient (4000 word count equivalence)</p><ul><li>30 minutes</li></ul><strong style="color: #ea4f62;">Hurdle requirement:</strong> Must pass this assessment in order to pass the subject - reassessment is available for this assessment</td><td>End of the teaching period </td><td>30%</td></tr><tr><td><p> Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE)  3 - 4 Hours of assessment (4000 word count equivalence) </p><ul><li>3-4 hours</li></ul><strong style="color: #ea4f62;">Hurdle requirement:</strong> Must pass this assessment to pass the subject - reassessment is available for this item of assessment</td><td>During the second half of the year </td><td>30%</td></tr><tr><td><p> Completion of an evidence-based dentistry written assignment (Pass/fail)</p><ul><li>1000 words</li></ul><strong style="color: #ea4f62;">Hurdle requirement:</strong> Must pass this assessment in order to pass the subject</td><td>During the second half of the year </td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td><p> Portfolio of ongoing patient care (Pass/Fail)</p><ul><li>20000 words</li></ul><strong style="color: #ea4f62;">Hurdle requirement:</strong> Must pass this assessment in order to pass the subject</td><td>Throughout the teaching period</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td><p> Multi-source feedback (Pass/Fail)</p><ul><li>4000 words (equivalent)</li></ul><strong style="color: #ea4f62;">Hurdle requirement:</strong> Must pass this assessment in order to pass the subject.</td><td>Throughout the teaching period</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td><p> Satisfactory Professional Behaviour (Pass/Fail)</p><strong style="color: #ea4f62;">Hurdle requirement:</strong> Satisfactory Professional Behaviour</td><td>Throughout the teaching period</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><p> Attendance at all Back-to-Base sessions &amp; Clinical Placements (including hospital rotations, On-Call, Emergency Service &amp; Field visits) (Pass/Fail)</p><strong style="color: #ea4f62;">Hurdle requirement:</strong> Attendance at all Back-to-Base sessions &amp; Clinical Placements (including hospital rotations, On-Call, Emergency Service &amp; Field visits)</td><td>Throughout the teaching period</td><td>N/A</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="assessment-description"></div><p class="last-updated">Last updated: 7 August 2024</p><h2>Dates & times</h2><ul class="accordion"><li class="accordion__visible"><div class="accordion__title">Year Long</div><div class="accordion__hidden"><table class="zebra contact_details"><tbody><tr><th>Principal coordinators</th><td>Denise Bailey Addison and Mathew Lim</td></tr><tr><th>Mode of delivery</th><td>On Campus (Parkville)</td></tr><tr><th>Contact hours</th><td></td></tr><tr><th>Total time commitment</th><td>1,600 hours</td></tr><tr><th>Pre teaching start date</th><td>18 January 2024</td></tr><tr><th>Pre teaching requirements</th><td>Attend Orientation activities.</td></tr><tr><th>Teaching period</th><td>22 January 2024 to 20 October 2024</td></tr><tr><th>Last self-enrol date</th><td>26 January 2024</td></tr><tr><th>Census date</th><td>31 May 2024</td></tr><tr><th>Last date to withdraw without fail</th><td>20 September 2024</td></tr><tr><th>Assessment period ends</th><td>15 November 2024</td></tr></tbody></table></div></li></ul><h2>Time commitment details</h2><p>985 contact hours (indicative), 615 non-contact hours (indicative)</p><h2>What do these dates mean</h2><p>Visit <a title="this webpage" href="https://students.unimelb.edu.au/your-course/manage-your-course/subject-enrolment/enrolling-in-subjects?in_c=sinfo-enrolment-key-dates%7Csource=handbook%7Cmedium=web%7Ccontent=keydates#enrolment-requirements-and-key-dates">this webpage</a> to find out about these key dates, including how they impact on:<br><br></p><ul>
