Students are also required to participate in Clinical Case Conference while they are on placement. Clinical Case conference is held weekly during the teaching period</p>
<p>Field placements may occur in a variety of child and adolescent mental health agencies across Melbourne. There will be a wide range of clients, clinical problems, assessments and outcomes across the age range as part of this experience. Some specialised experiences with particular disorders and settings will be available. The placements will provide students with an opportunity to gain valuable experience in the professional practice of clinical psychology. Students will be expected to see children, adolescents and families for assessment and individual treatment and to demonstrate that they possess the knowledge and skills to assess, diagnose and provide interventions for a variety of diagnostic problems. The integration of the placement experiential learning and the didactic content in course subjects and clinical case conference will provide students with the opportunities to evaluate the most appropriate interventions for a given disorder using evidence based treatment models. Generally students will be required to commit two days per week to external placements for 27 weeks of the year.</p>
<p>Supervisors for the field placement component will be registered as both psychologists and supervisors with the Psychologists Registration Board of Victoria. In most cases they will also be a member (or eligible for membership) of the College of Clinical Psychologists of the Australian Psychological Society. The field supervisors will be responsible for ensuring that students are adequately introduced to the field setting and for day-to-day supervision of the student’s placement. Field Supervisors will ensure that students are exposed to a range of clinical work, as far as possible allowing the student to function as would a clinical psychologist within the facility. Clinical Case Conference (Co-ordinator: Dr Lisa Phillips/Dr Rowena Conroy).</p>
<p>There are two major purposes for the clinical case conference. The first is to provide the opportunity (structure, feedback) for students to gain skills in presenting case material in an effective, professional manner, with emphases on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Selection of material (clinical content and focus of presentation)</li>
<li>Organisation of the material (format; use of overheads, etc)</li>
<li>Personal presentation skills</li>
<li>Physical environment</li>
<li>Timing of presentations</li>
<li>Evaluation/feedback</li>
</ul>
<p>The second is to provide the opportunity for students to discuss selected clinical issues in a large group format, with emphases on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus/purpose for formal case presentations</li>
<li>Integration of clinical and research material within scientist-practitioner framework of professional practice.</li>
<li>Discussion of broad professional and ethical issues</li>
<li>Implementation of professional skills Child specialisation students will alternate between a Clinical Case Conference taken with Clinical and Neuropsychology Students and a specialised Child Clinical Case Conference</li>
</ul><div id="learning-outcomes"><h2>Intended learning outcomes</h2><p>The subject aims to provide the students with opportunities to experience a range of clinical presentations in paediatric and adolescent mental health and to begin functioning as a clinical psychologist, under the supervision of a field supervisor. Students will receive experience in history taking, conducting assessments, arriving at a case formulation and making treatment plans. Under supervision, students will be given the opportunity to develop competency in the provision of psychological treatments to individual children, adolescents and families, and (where appropriate) groups. In addition, the subject aims to give the student experience of professional psychology practice, including professional presentation, report writing and record keeping, managing a clinical caseload, and liaison with other professional practitioners. </p></div><div id="generic-skills"><h2>Generic skills</h2><p><span>This placement subject is designed to promote an in-dept understanding of specialist practice, to expand the range of ways in which learning occurs; to develop a capacity to work collaboratively, to confront and manage unfamiliar problems, to value different cultures, and to develop a high regard for human rights, ethics and equity.</span></p></div></div><p class="last-updated">Last updated: 31 January 2024</p><h2>Eligibility and requirements</h2><div id="prerequisites"><h3>Prerequisites</h3><p><table class="zebra course_structure" data-sortable="">

<ul>
<li><span>Experience in the administration and interpretation of a range of psychological assessment strategies and the writing of psychological reports;</span></li>
<li><span>understanding of typical courses and prognoses of disorders, and capacity to develop appropriate treatment and management plans;</span></li>

</ul>
<p><span>If it becomes apparent during placement that the student’s performance is inadequate in some respect, then the supervisors will attempt to rectify deficiencies, if necessary by requiring the student to undergo further training. Students who do not receive a satisfactory report from their placement supervisor may be required to complete a further placement before being passed in this component. </span><span>The final decision as to whether the student has successfully completed placement will be taken by the course convenor. </span></p></div><p class="last-updated">Last updated: 31 January 2024</p><h2>Dates & times</h2><ul class="accordion"><li class="accordion__visible"><div class="accordion__title">Year Long</div><div class="accordion__hidden"><table class="zebra contact_details"><tbody><tr><th>Principal coordinator</th><td>Rowena Conroy</td></tr><tr><th>Mode of delivery</th><td>On Campus (Parkville)</td></tr><tr><th>Contact hours</th><td>55 placement days over the year. 1.5 hour conference per week for 24 weeks.</td></tr><tr><th>Teaching period</th><td>26 February 2024 to 20 October 2024</td></tr><tr><th>Last self-enrol date</th><td> 8 March 2024</td></tr><tr><th>Census date</th><td>31 May 2024</td></tr><tr><th>Last date to withdraw without fail</th><td>20 September 2024</td></tr><tr><th>Assessment period ends</th><td>15 November 2024</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Year Long contact information</h3> <div class="course__body__inner__contact_details"><p>Sarah Drew</p><p><a href="mailto:sarah@unimelb.edu.au">sarah@unimelb.edu.au</a> </p></div></div></li></ul><h2>What do these dates mean</h2><p>Visit <a title="this webpage" href="https://students.unimelb.edu.au/your-course/manage-your-course/subject-enrolment/enrolling-in-subjects?in_c=sinfo-enrolment-key-dates%7Csource=handbook%7Cmedium=web%7Ccontent=keydates#enrolment-requirements-and-key-dates">this webpage</a> to find out about these key dates, including how they impact on:<br><br></p><ul>
