Using examples from legal and public culture, this subject examines in depth the ways in which we make sense of law, crime and killing.</p>
<p>The subject begins with the doctrinal history of murder and allied crimes in order to present the central concepts of the law of homicide and of this subject. It then moves to consider the processes of proof and punishment of murder, before turning to an in-depth study of a variety of specific legal and cultural forms of murder.</p>
<p>The overall themes of the subject are three: encounters between legal and cultural responses to the crime of murder; the nature of the difficulties that murder presents for criminal law and public culture; narratives of community, memory and responsibility constructed by responses to murder and its aftermath.</p>
<p>These themes will be explored through an in-depth treatment of the complex problems and forms of knowledge from a range of illustrative topics. In any given year, topics will be chosen from amongst the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The public culture of murder, law and homicide;</li>
<li>serial killing, public trials and pre-trial publicity;</li>
<li>history and the changing patterns of homicide law;</li>
<li>mercy, infanticide and child homicide</li>
<li>literary representations of unlawful murder;</li>
<li>proof, intention and circumstantial evidence</li>
<li>defences such as self defence and provocation, mental impairment and diminished responsibility;</li>
<li>family violence and conjugal homicide;</li>
<li>sentencing and homicide;</li>
<li>homicide, coroners and deaths in custody</li>
<li>corporate killings and workplace deaths (including environmental disasters); and</li>
<li>law reform of homicide.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples will be drawn from legal texts and judgments, and from podcasts, literature, film, and the arts more widely. In this way, the subject compares and integrates the responses of criminal law and public culture in making sense of law, crime and killing.</p><div id="learning-outcomes"><h2>Intended learning outcomes</h2><div id="LO1"><p>A student who has successfully completed this subject should have an advanced understanding of the law of murder, as well as be able to critically analyse, engage with, and evaluate to a high standard the forms of representation, bodies of knowledge and practices that compose this specialised area of legal study.
