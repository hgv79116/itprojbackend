Students will apply knowledge of disease processes, anatomy, common materials, equipment and instrumentation, and techniques for the management of caries (decay) and periodontal (gum) diseases. Students will undertake tasks on manikins to develop skills in preparing and restoring lost tooth structure (fillings), and in periodontal cleaning. Students will learn about correct posture, safety, and working as a team (assistant and operator) in the dental operatory during the provision of these procedures.</p><div id="learning-outcomes"><h2>Intended learning outcomes</h2><div id="LO1"><p>On completion of this subject the students will be competent in:</p><ul class="ticked-list"><li id="LO1-1">the use of dental instruments for surgical management of dental caries;</li><li id="LO1-2">restoring teeth requiring small restorations on manikins;</li><li id="LO1-3">pplication of concepts of minimal intervention to clinical dental practice;</li><li id="LO1-4">self-evaluating the precision and accuracy of appropriate surgical removal of extensive caries;</li><li id="LO1-5">restoring teeth with extensive carious lesions on manikins;</li><li id="LO1-6">making an appropriate selection of a dental material and restoring teeth to its original anatomical contour, function and form in manikins;</li><li id="LO1-7">using dental rotary cutting instruments for restoration and conservation of dental hard tissues with safe and precise manual dexterity;</li><li id="LO1-8">understanding concepts related to the risks and hazards of using instrumentation in the confined space of the oral cavity;</li><li id="LO1-9">the correct selection of the restorative material which will best restore a tooth to its original form and function;</li><li id="LO1-10">the basic principles applied in the design and execution of the preparation of cavities to restore carious and non-carious lesions;</li><li id="LO1-11">using instruments appropriately for removal of plaque (tooth debridement) on manikins.</li></ul></div></div><div id="generic-skills"><h2>Generic skills</h2><ul><li id="GS1">be able to access new knowledge from different sources, analyse and interpret it in a critical manner;</li><li id="GS2">develop skills in effective communication with teaching staff and peers;</li><li id="GS3">develop effective organizational skills and time management;</li><li id="GS4">develop skills in team work;</li><li id="GS5">be able to identify and address their own learning needs (self evaluation);</li><li id="GS6">understand the need for precision, accuracy and self-evaluation;</li><li id="GS7">be able to handle and dispose of chemicals and other laboratory materials safely following proper protocol.</li></ul></div></div><p class="last-updated">Last updated: 30 January 2024</p><h2>Eligibility and requirements</h2><div id="prerequisites"><h3>Prerequisites</h3><p>None</p></div><h3>Corequisites</h3><p>None</p><h3>Non-allowed subjects</h3><p>None</p><h3>Inherent requirements (core participation requirements)</h3><p>A candidate for the Melbourne DOCTOR OF DENTAL SURGERY must have abilities and skills in the following five categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>observation;</li>
<li>communication;</li>
<li>motor;</li>
<li>conceptual, integrative, and quantitative;</li>
<li>behavioural and social.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I. Observation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Practical Classes</strong></p>
<p>The student must be able to observe mandatory demonstrations and experiments in the designated subjects.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Work</strong></p>
<p>The student must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand. Observation necessitates the functional use of the senses of vision, hearing and somatic sensation. It is enhanced by the functional use of the sense of smell.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>II. Communication:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Practical Classes</strong></p>
<p>The student must be able to hear and comprehend instructions in laboratories and practical sessions and be able to clearly and independently communicate knowledge and application of the principles and practices of the subject during assessment tasks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Work</strong></p>
<p>A student must be able to hear, to speak, and to observe patients in order to elicit information, describe changes in mood, activity, and posture and perceive nonverbal communications. A student must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients in both oral and written modalities. The student must also be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in both oral and written modes with all members of the health care team, including using telephones and computers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>III. Motor:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Practical Classes</strong></p>
<p>A student must be able to undertake the motor requirements for any mandatory practical sessions. Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium, and functional use of the senses of touch and vision.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Work</strong></p>
<p>Students should have good motor function to elicit information from patients by physical examination; for example palpation, percussion, and other diagnostic manoeuvres. Students should possess sufficient manual dexterity to be able to perform procedures required as a dental practitioner. The student should be able to execute motor movements reasonably required to provide general dental care and emergency treatment to patients. Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium, hand eye coordination and functional use of the senses of touch and vision.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Intellectual-Conceptual, Integrative and Quantitative Abilities:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Practical Classes</strong></p>
<p>The student is expected to have the ability to develop problem-solving skills and demonstrate this ability in practical sessions. These abilities include measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis, and synthesis. Problem solving requires all of these intellectual abilities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Work</strong></p>
<p>The student is expected to have the ability to develop problem-solving skills and demonstrate the ability to establish oral health care plans and priorities. These abilities include measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis, and synthesis. Problem solving requires all of these intellectual abilities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>V. Behavioural and Social Attributes:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Practical Classes</strong></p>
<p>A student must possess the emotional health required for full utilization of his/her intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgement, the prompt completion of all required tasks, and display professional behaviour at all times.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Work</strong></p>
<p>A student must possess the emotional health required for full utilization of his/her intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgement, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients. A student must display professional behaviour at all times and develop mature, sensitive, and effective relationships with patients and colleagues.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>It is a requirement of the course that students will be expected to physically examine their peers (of all genders) in teaching settings and patients (of all genders) in clinics.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The University is dedicated to provide support to those with special requirements. Further details can be found at the Student Equity and Disability Support website: <a href="http://www.services.unimelb.edu.au/disability/">http://www.services.unimelb.edu.au/disability/</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Melbourne Dental School policy outlining requirements in relation to student disability for entry to and progression within the DOCTOR OF DENTAL SURGERY are outlined below.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Melbourne Dental School Policy in Relation to Students with Disabilities</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The curriculum of the DOCTOR OF DENTAL SURGERY has been developed using 64 graduate attribute statements in six domains (professionalism, scientific knowledge, patient care, dental profession, systems of health care and the society). Students entering the Melbourne DOCTOR OF DENTAL SURGERY must therefore have the aptitude to achieve these attributes during the course in readiness for progression to independent practice.</p>
<p>The Melbourne Dental School welcomes applications from students with disabilities. It is University and Faculty policy to take all reasonable steps to minimise the impact of disability upon academic study. Appropriate adjustments will be made to enhance the participation of students with a disability in the dental course. A prospective student with a disability is advised to discuss with Student Equity and Disability Support any issues related to his or her ability to successfully meet all the course and subsequent registration requirements.</p>
<p>All students of the DOCTOR OF DENTAL SURGERY must possess the intellectual, ethical, physical and emotional capabilities required to participate in the full curriculum and to achieve the levels of competence at graduation required by the faculty and the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation agency.</p>
<p>A student with a disability may be asked to provide independent medical or other clinical assessments of the disability and its possible impact on the ability of the student to successfully complete the course, before being accepted into the course. This statement would be treated in confidence with only those on the admissions committee and the Student Equity and Disability Support having access to the document.</p>
<p>Deliberate misinformation about the student’s ability to successfully complete the course will be regarded as unprofessional practice and treated as such.</p>
<p>While the Melbourne Dental School will make reasonable adjustments to minimise the impact of a disability, all students must be able to participate in the program in an independent manner. It is not reasonable for students to use an intermediary as an adjustment to compensate for a disability impacting on any of the five categories. In the clinical environment there is a primary duty of care to the patients and the needs of students cannot compromise this. It is expected that all students will be able to participate fully in all classroom based learning activities and to successfully fulfil the self-study requirements of the course. The presence of a disability will not automatically entitle the student to preferential treatment in clinical place allocation.</p><p class="last-updated">Last updated: 30 January 2024</p><h2>Assessment</h2><div class="assessment-table"><table class="assessment-details"><thead><tr><th>Description</th><th>Timing</th><th>Percentage</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p> 1 x practical exam on Conservative Dentistry</p><ul><li>2 hours</li></ul></td><td>To be held in May</td><td>15%</td></tr><tr><td><p> 1 x practical exam on manual dexterity skills in tooth preparation</p><ul><li>90 minutes</li></ul></td><td>To be held in August</td><td>15%</td></tr><tr><td><p> 1 x practical exam on manual dexterity skills in tooth preparation</p><ul><li>90 minutes</li></ul></td><td>To be held late September / early October</td><td>15%</td></tr><tr><td><p> 2 x 30-minute class tests on manikins with simulated periodontal disease on tooth debridement; 5% each</p><ul><li>60 minutes</li></ul></td><td>To be held in June and September</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td><p> 1 x practical exam on manual dexterity skills in tooth preparation</p><ul><li>90 minutes</li></ul></td><td>End of the teaching period</td><td>30%</td></tr><tr><td><p> 1 x class test on manikins with simulated periodontal disease on tooth debridement</p><ul><li>30 minutes</li></ul></td><td>End of the teaching period</td><td>15%</td></tr><tr><td><strong style="color: #ea4f62;">Hurdle requirement:</strong> Students must pass both assessment items 5 and 6 (90-minute practical exam on manual dexterity skills in tooth preparation and 30-minute class test on manikins with simulated periodontal disease on tooth debridement) in order to pass overall.</td><td></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><strong style="color: #ea4f62;">Hurdle requirement:</strong> 75% attendance at Lectures; 100% attendance at Practical Classes (including Computer Assisted Learning [CAL])</td><td>Throughout the teaching period</td><td>N/A</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="assessment-description"></div><p class="last-updated">Last updated: 30 January 2024</p><h2>Dates & times</h2><p class="notice notice--warning">Not available in 2024</p><h2>Time commitment details</h2><p>115 contact hours (indicative), 40 non-contact hours (indicative)</p><p class="last-updated">Last updated: 30 January 2024</p><h2>Further information</h2><ul class="accordion"><li class="texts accordion__visible"><div class="accordion__title">Texts</div><div class="accordion__hidden"><h3>Prescribed texts</h3><p>There are no specifically prescribed or recommended texts for this subject.</p></div></li></ul><p class="last-updated">Last updated: 30 January 2024</p></div></div></div></div><svg class="hidden" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><symbol id="icon-hb-external-link" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M14,3V5H17.59L7.76,14.83L9.17,16.24L19,6.41V10H21V3M19,19H5V5H12V3H5C3.89,3 3,3.9 3,5V19A2,2 0 0,0 5,21H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,19V12H19V19Z"></path></symbol><symbol id="icon-hb-subdir" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,15L13,21L11.58,19.58L15.17,16H4V4H6V14H15.17L11.58,10.42L13,9L19,15Z"></path></symbol></svg></div></div></div></body></html>
