Studies have shown that while extended periods of intercultural engagement are important for student development of independence and intercultural communication skills, it is just as important for students to have a framework for analysing their own intercultural interactions. Such frameworks and reflections serve to enhance students’ ability to interact and lead effectively across cultures.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The aim of this subject is to assist students as they engage in self-reflective practices and exchange these reflections with fellow students online to better understand their overseas learning experiences. Encouraging students to reflect on their overseas learning within a supportive community of peers will promote, facilitate, and support enhanced learning practices for students who participate in this subject. Apart from exchanging information and advice with each other, students will also read and reflect on research that has been conducted by others in this area of studying abroad.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The delivery of this subject is governed by the differences in locations and time zones students are located in. As such an online discussion forum will be created as analogous to real “classroom” discussions where questions will be posed and can then be answered by students over the course of a week or so. Students will access these online discussions to reflect on their own experience and by reading the online material provided by the subject coordinator.</p><div id="learning-outcomes"><h2>Intended learning outcomes</h2><p>The aim in providing this subject is to add further value to Exchange Students’ Study Abroad experience. This subject can better facilitate students’ transition into new and unfamiliar teaching environments. By exchanging experiences and strategies; by reading research papers; and by reflecting about studying abroad, students may be better able to identify key issues that may be inhibiting their learning ability overseas. Ultimately as students become better equipped to interpret and understand how they are learning they may then be able to better identify future career paths or opportunities for ongoing collaborative international work experience.</p><div id="LO1"><p>This subject will enhance students’ competencies in the following areas:</p><br /><p> </p><ul class="ticked-list"><li id="LO1-0">Exposure to and understanding of advanced academic research on intercultural interaction effectiveness.</li><li id="LO1-2">Ability to reflect on overseas learning experiences within a supportive community of peers.</li><li id="LO1-3">Cross-cultural analysis of their discipline areas of study.</li></ul></div><div id="LO2"><p>At the completion of this subject, students should:</p><ul class="ticked-list"><li id="LO2-0">Be familiar with the concepts associated with Culture Shock and Intercultural Effectiveness</li><li id="LO2-2">Better understand the implications and complexities of intercultural communication.</li><li id="LO2-3">Have improved intercultural communication skills</li><li id="LO2-5">Be able to discuss the different international and cultural perspectives that may exist around their chosen discipline area</li></ul></div></div><div id="generic-skills"><h2>Generic skills</h2><p>At the completion of the subject, students should have learnt more about how to:</p><ul class="ticked-list">
<li>Interact successfully across cultures</li>
<li>Improve their analytical skills – specifically the ability to conduct analysis using different cultural perspectives</li>
<li>Enhance their ability to formulate and articulate rational argument through on-line discussions</li>
<li>Develop further their abilities to engage critically with the subject literature</li>
<li>Learn to apply theory to practice in online discussions and reflections</li>
<li>Optimise the capabilities of online social networking tools.</li>
