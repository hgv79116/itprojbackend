<p>This subject requires Teacher Candidates to demonstrate their developing professional knowledge, clinical practice, and professional engagement. Guided by the National Quality Framework, Teacher Candidates will extend their ability to closely observe children’s learning and development, taking increasing responsibility for the planning, implementation and evaluation of learning experiences, demonstrating their developing understanding of children’s progression along learning and development trajectories. Teacher Candidates will continue to differentiate their teaching to include students with diverse needs and backgrounds and will take into account Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives on learning and development. Experienced Mentor Teachers will continue to support Teacher Candidates in collaboration with academics who have relevant areas of expertise.</p>
<p>The Clinical Teaching Practice seminars are framed by the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers at the Graduate Level. At seminars, Teacher Candidates will engage in collaborative learning and critical reflection.</p>
<p>In this subject, Teacher Candidates also undertake five days’ clinical teaching practice in a primary school, observing teaching and learning in the early years of formal school education and engaging in team-teaching. During this school-based teaching practice, experienced primary teachers mentor Teacher Candidates in collaboration with academics.</p>
