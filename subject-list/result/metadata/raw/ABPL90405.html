The operation of buildings alone represents around 40% of energy use in many developed economies. Reducing energy use and transitioning towards zero greenhouse emissions in the built environment is therefore critical to sustain the Earth’s ecosystems and the general environmental equilibrium of the planet. This is further recognised by the UN sustainability goals, namely<em> Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities</em>. With a growing world population, most of which going to live in cities, addressing this current and upcoming challenge is paramount.</p>
<p><strong>The aim of this subject is to equip students with the skills and knowledge required to analyse, quantify, visualise and improve the energy performance of buildings, neighbourhoods and cities, at different scales of the built environment, towards zero greenhouse gas emissions.</strong></p>
<p>This subject is designed to capitalise on the multi-disciplinary nature of participants. As such, it uses active discussions, interactive problem solving, peer review and group work, among other teaching and learning activities. In addition, the major assessment task is designed to allow for a significant amount of flexibility as you will be able to determine the focus of your own assignment. You will also be able to vote to determine subject content towards the end of the semester.</p><div id="learning-outcomes"><h2>Intended learning outcomes</h2><p>On completion of the subject, students should be able to:</p><ul class="ticked-list"><li id="LO1">Identify, map and evaluate the key drivers of energy use and greenhouse gas emissions at different scales of the built environment</li><li id="LO2">Quantify the life cycle energy and greenhouse gas emissions of particular systems, across scales of the built environment;</li><li id="LO3">Design a range of interventions that improve environmental performance in the built environment and quantify the improvement</li><li id="LO4">Appreciate the potential of interdisciplinary action towards reducing net energy use and zeroing greenhouse gas emissions in the built environment</li><li id="LO5">Design and use different information graphics and data visualisations to communicate complex information effectively</li></ul></div><div id="generic-skills"><h2>Generic skills</h2><ul><li id="GS1">1.

</li></ul></div></div><p class="last-updated">Last updated: 31 January 2024</p><h2>Eligibility and requirements</h2><div id="prerequisites"><h3>Prerequisites</h3><p>None</p></div><h3>Corequisites</h3><p>None</p><h3>Non-allowed subjects</h3><p>None</p><h3>Recommended background knowledge</h3><p>Knowledge and interest in environmental performance such as passive buildings, urban environmental policy and planning, energy modelling, renewable energy, renewable materials or other relevant field</p><h3>Inherent requirements (core participation requirements)</h3><div>The Melbourne School of Design is the graduate school of the Faculty of Architecture, Building and Planning. It offers professional entry programs in Architecture, Construction Management, Landscape Architecture, Property and Urban Planning. It offers specialist development programs in Property Valuation, Planning and Design, Urban Design, and in Environmental Design.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Melbourne School of Design welcomes applications from students with disabilities. It is the University and Faculty (Architecture, Building and Planning) policy to take reasonable steps to make reasonable adjustments so as to enable students’ participation in degrees offered by the Melbourne School of Design (MSD).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A candidate for Energy and Carbon in the Built Environment must have abilities and skills which include the following: observation; communication; motor; conceptual, integrative, and quantitative; and behavioural and social. Adjustments can be provided to minimise the impact of a disability, however, particularly at a Graduate level, students need to be able to participate in programs in an independent manner and with regard to their safety and the safety of others.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>(i) Observation: Candidates must be able to read text, diagrams, maps, drawings and numerical data. Candidates should be able to observe details at a number of scales and to record useful observations of environmental contexts.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>(ii) Communication: Candidates should be able to communicate with fellow students, professional and academic staff, members of relevant professions and the public. Candidates must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively. Communication includes not only speech but also reading and writing, presenting one's own work in front of a large group, receiving and responding to feedback about one's own work in a public setting.</div>
<div>(iii) Motor: Candidates should have sufficient motor function to elicit information from environmental contexts. Off campus investigations may include visits to construction sites, urban, rural and/or remote environments. Candidates should have sufficient motor ability to prepare documentation of analytic texts, drawings and models of findings and for the reparation of proposals for environmental interventions via digital or other means. Candidates should have the ability to actively participate in appropriate site and/or design studio-based activities.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>(iv) Intellectual-Conceptual, Integrative and Quantitative Abilities: These abilities include measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis, synthesis and, importantly, the ability to interpret results of such work. Problem resolution, the critical skill demanded of graduates, requires all of these intellectual abilities. In addition, given the disciplines pursued in the SD, candidates should be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationships in environmental structures of a wide range of scales – from smaller than the individual through individual buildings and urban spaces to large geographic areas. Further, graduate study entails learning to master one’s own abilities and skills and to deploy them strategically. This requires further developing skills in both reflective and reflexive thinking and being able to practice these skills.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>(v) Behavioural and Social Attributes: A candidate must possess behavioural and social attributes that enable them to participate in a complex learning environment. Students are required to take responsibility for their own participation and learning. They also contribute to the learning of other students in collaborative learning environments, demonstrating interpersonal skills and an understanding of the needs of other students. Assessment may include the outcomes of tasks completed in collaboration with other students.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Students who feel a disability will prevent them from meeting the above academic requirements are encouraged to contact the Disability Liaison Unit.</div>
