Increasingly, cities are asserting themselves as international actors while also coming to be regulated by global lawmaking processes. This subject offers an in-depth inquiry into international law and global governance, viewed through the lens of the city. Relevant both to scholars and practitioners, the course critically assesses the international legal framework in which cities in the global north and south are coming to be enmeshed, with a focus on the city-scale governance of climate change, urban security, human rights and the financial sector.</p>
<p>The subject will combine interactive lectures with group presentations, invited speakers and the use of documentaries and new media. Readings will be drawn from law and a wide range of other disciplines, including international relations, history, geography, development, sociology, anthropology, architecture, planning and philosophy. The more theoretical texts will be complemented by primary sources allowing students to develop a close reading on one of the most topical developments in contemporary global governance and international law.</p>
<p>Principal topics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cities, International Law and Global Governance Today</li>
<li>Cities and the Evolution of the International Legal Order: From State Sovereignty to a Transformation of the International Legal Order from Below</li>
<li>Cities and Liveability: Human Rights and the Emergence of the Right to the City</li>
<li>Cities and Climate Change: Between the Paris Agreement and the Local Realization of the Sustainable Development Goals</li>
<li>Cities and Security: Law, Governance and the Architecture in Quest of Safe Spaces</li>
<li>Cities and Finance: Governing the Financial Sector through and for Cities</li>
