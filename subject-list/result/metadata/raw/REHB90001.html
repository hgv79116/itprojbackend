The subject will provide students with the opportunity to gain knowledge and develop skills related to the selection and delivery of appropriate and best practice rehabilitation services that are tailored to meet the needs of individuals, groups, or services. Students will gain skills, demonstrate understanding, and critically review the applicability of a range of models to deliver rehabilitation services including interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, community and home-based.</p>
<p>The subject is divided into modules to allow flexibility for students to choose areas of rehabilitation practice that best match their disciplinary interests or work context. Assessment will include the development of single discipline and multidisciplinary rehabilitation that can be used in a clinical context. All students will complete four modules within this subject.</p>
<p>Module 1: A Foundational Module will be completed by all students and introduces the theory underpinning and defining key features of best practice in rehabilitation. A theoretical framework, based on the International Classification of Functioning (WHO), will be introduced as a method of classification and consideration of the rehabilitation needs of an individual. Students will acquire skills in mapping the impact of health conditions into multiple domains and considering the associated personal and environmental factors though a series of diverse case studies. The constructs of habilitation and rehabilitation will be explored in the context of lifelong disabilities. A range of models of rehabilitation services will be introduced.</p>
<p>Modules 2 and 3: Students will then choose two from three modules that best meet their learning interests and/or practice or discipline interests. These modules are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adult rehabilitation services</li>
<li>Paediatric rehabilitation services</li>
<li>Rehabilitation policy and regulation</li>
</ul>
<p>Students selecting the adults and paediatric modules will develop the skills to identify literature related to a rehabilitation method or approach used in their own setting. Students will develop a concise summary of the existing evidence, critically evaluate the quality of evidence to support the chosen intervention. Students will identify and justifying core elements of rehabilitation services provided across a patient journey in different care settings. This will include gathering, synthesising and appraising evidence, as well as applying this to practice considering personal and environmental factors.</p>
<p>The Rehabilitation policy and regulation module will allow students to identify and analyse the relevant government and local health policy that influences equitable access to rehabilitation services. This will be explored within their own context and contrasted with policy from other global regions. The potential influence of service access on patient outcomes will be considered in depth.</p>
<p>Module 4: The final integration module will be completed by all students and addresses the integration and application of evidence informed rehabilitation practice. This module provides students with an opportunity to extend and demonstrate skills in developing and justifying evidence-informed rehabilitation programs and to hear from rehabilitation experts.</p><div id="learning-outcomes"><h2>Intended learning outcomes</h2><p>The curriculum is designed around three elements which provide both horizontal and vertical integration throughout the program. These elements are: rehabilitation theory and practice, evidence and innovation and clinical practice in context.</p>

<li>applying knowledge, information and research skills to complex problems in a range of contexts skills and examining issues with multiple disciplinary perspectives</li>
<li>awareness of the social and cultural diversity in communities</li>
<li>placing great importance on their personal and professional integrity</li>
<li>demonstrating enthusiasm, self-assurance and confidence in their knowledge, yet flexible, adaptable and aware of their limitations</li>
