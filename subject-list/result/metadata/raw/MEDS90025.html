This will be achieved in three 4-week clinical placements and two weeks of face-to-face teaching and learning, as well as a series of small-group tutorials and online learning sessions.</p>
<p>1. ‘Preparation for Practice’ connects students’ prior learning throughout the MD program to the delivery of safe and effective practice. This will be achieved with a variety of approaches including simulation, small group tutorials and practical sessions. Some of the ‘Preparation for Practice’ content will occur during the allocated fortnight of face-to-face teaching, with the rest to take place as online learning sessions or tutorials throughout the remainder of Transition to Practice.</p>
<p>2. Students will rotate through three 4-week clinical placement terms:</p>
<p>a. Two ‘Trainee Intern’ terms provide students with opportunities to rehearse the role of an intern in a hospital-based medical or surgical unit. Students will be supported to reflect on their experiences within this term to allow a smooth and less stressful transition to internship.</p>
<p>b. A ‘Trainee Intern Selective’ term allows students to select a specific medical discipline for more in-depth experience working with an individual clinician or medical team.</p>
<p>The subject culminates in a leadership course at the end of their final rotation.</p><div id="learning-outcomes"><h2>Intended learning outcomes</h2><p>In line with the graduate attributes of the Doctor of Medicine, by the end of the subject students should have developed the following objectives under these domains:<br /><br /></p><div id="LO1"><p><strong>As a scholar and scientist</strong></p><ul class="ticked-list"><li id="LO1-1">Theme: Clinician Scientist (Knowledge) Apply biomedical sciences knowledge including determinants of health to explain the underlying mechanisms of patient presentation and response to care, and rationale for ongoing management </li><li id="LO1-2">Theme: Clinician Scientist (Skills) Propose a scientifically supported rationale for the entire patient course, including presentation, differential diagnosis, management and response to care across the age spectrum</li><li id="LO1-3">Theme: Clinician Researcher (Skills) Apply the key principles of evidence-based medicine to clinical judgements and collaborative decision making, recognising the individual patient and the heath system and community context.</li></ul></div><div id="LO2"><p><strong>As a medical practitioner</strong></p><ul class="ticked-list"><li id="LO2-1">Theme: Patient Assessment (Knowledge) Integrate knowledge of biomedical sciences, illness trajectories, patient focused care and determinants of health, to develop a focused patient assessment and investigation plan.  </li><li id="LO2-2">Theme: Patient Assessment (Skills) Select and perform initial and ongoing assessment of patients, including information gathering, involving carers/ informants where relevant, focused physical examination and appropriate investigations, demonstrating adaptations for differing physiological, psychosocial, cultural and care contexts.</li><li id="LO2-3">Theme: Clinical Reasoning (Knowledge) Synthesize ongoing clinical assessment findings with appropriate adaptations for  psychosocial, cultural and care contexts, to develop and refine the differential diagnoses, the likely diagnosis, and tailor the preliminary management plan.</li><li id="LO2-4">Theme: Clinical Reasoning (Skills) Organise and communicate to patient, and all members of the healthcare team, clinical assessment findings with appropriate adaptations for  psychosocial, cultural and care contexts, to develop a differential diagnosis, refine the likely dignoses and contribute to care planning.</li><li id="LO2-5">Theme: Partnership with patient (Knowledge) Appraisal of patient and families to  preferences and priorities in order to develop shared and acceptable treatment goals while ensuring patient agency for self-care and management.</li><li id="LO2-6">Theme: Partnership with patient (Skills) Work with health care team members, patients and their families to develop mutually acceptable health maintenance, health promotion and disease prevention, management and advance care plans and communicate these plans clearly and appropriately through admission, referral, discharge and medicolegal processes.</li></ul></div><div id="LO3"><p><strong>As a health advocate</strong></p><ul class="ticked-list"><li id="LO3-1">Theme: Determinants of health (Knowledge) Explain how diverse global, systemic, social and individual factors contribute to health status and health inequities within patient populations.</li><li id="LO3-2">Theme: Determinants of health (Skills) Advocate for better local and global health outcomes with individual patients, or patient groups, by application of the principles of equity and diversity within their health experiences.</li><li id="LO3-3">Theme: First Nations Health (Knowledge) Critically analyse the Australian healthcare system&#39;s impact on First Nations peoples&#39;
