The subject will consist of the following components: current issues in health care; population oral health; law and ethics; behavioural science; communication skills; dental materials; radiography and radiology; introduction to history, examination, diagnosis and treatment planning; restorative dentistry; infection control and safety in clinical settings; and removable prosthodontics.</p>
<p>Students will be introduced to the basic concepts of biomaterials and biomechanics related to dentistry, the broad groupings of materials applied to clinical practice and methods used for testing materials. They will also be introduced to dental radiology; dental radiographic techniques and interpretation of radiographs. </p>
<p>Student learning will include patient centred oral health care practice. They will be introduced to the concept and evidence of minimal intervention dentistry and how it relates to non-surgical management and surgical treatment of dental caries and restoration of teeth. Students will gain knowledge of dental materials commonly used for direct restorative procedures.</p>
<p>Students will develop knowledge and skills regarding clinical dental practice. The clinical procedures of history taking, clinical examination, diagnosis and provision of simple treatment plans will be introduced and students will gain knowledge of dental record keeping requirements.  Students will gain knowledge of their responsibilities under the law to provide a safe environment for their patients, staff and themselves together with knowledge of the current published standards of practice. Students will also gain knowledge of infection control strategies, practice protocols and documentation required to provide a safe clinical environment. Clinical sessions will allow students to practise and reinforce the skills in safe work practices and infection control procedures while practising the clinical skills of history taking, clinical examination, plaque index, prophylaxis and application of topical fluoride. During these clinical sessions, students will develop skills in ergonomic work practices in a clinical environment.</p>
<p>Students will cover the changes of orofacial structures that occur after tooth loss and how these affect oral health and function. Students will also learn the construction of complete dentures through a series of interactive lectures, videos and laboratory practical sessions. Students will learn the processes and materials needed for impression taking and construction of a special impression tray, mounting dentate maxillary and mandibular casts on dental articulators which are used for construction of indirect prostheses and for analysis of diagnostic casts during treatment planning, and will acquire skills in construction of occlusal splints. </p><div id="learning-outcomes"><h2>Intended learning outcomes</h2><p>On completion of this subject, the student should be able to<br /><br /></p><ul class="ticked-list"><li id="LO1">discuss the range of oral health care needs of individuals and groups within the community and the diversity of the methods needed to provide them;</li><li id="LO2">comprehend the range of patients&#39;

Students should possess sufficient manual dexterity to be able to perform procedures required as a dental practitioner. The student should be able to execute motor movements reasonably required to provide general dental care and emergency treatment to patients. Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium, hand eye coordination and functional use of the senses of touch and vision.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>IV. Intellectual-Conceptual, Integrative and Quantitative Abilities:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Practical Classes</strong></p>
<p>The student is expected to have the ability to develop problem-solving skills and demonstrate this ability in practical sessions. These abilities include measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis, and synthesis. Problem solving requires all of these intellectual abilities.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Clinical Work</strong></p>
<p>The student is expected to have the ability to develop problem-solving skills and demonstrate the ability to establish oral health care plans and priorities. These abilities include measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis, and synthesis. Problem solving requires all of these intellectual abilities.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>V. Behavioural and Social Attributes:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Practical Classes</strong></p>
<p>A student must possess the emotional health required for full utilization of his/her intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgement, the prompt completion of all required tasks, and display professional behaviour at all times.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Clinical Work</strong></p>
<p>A student must possess the emotional health required for full utilization of his/her intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgement, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients. A student must display professional behaviour at all times and develop mature, sensitive, and effective relationships with patients and colleagues.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>It is a requirement of the course that students will be expected to physically examine their peers (of all genders) in teaching settings and patients (of all genders) in clinics.</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The University is dedicated to provide support to those with special requirements. Further details can be found at the Student Equity and Disability Support website: <a href="http://www.services.unimelb.edu.au/disability/">http://www.services.unimelb.edu.au/disability/</a></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Melbourne Dental School policy outlining requirements in relation to student disability for entry to and progression within the DOCTOR OF DENTAL SURGERY are outlined below.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Melbourne Dental School Policy in Relation to Students with Disabilities</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The curriculum of the DOCTOR OF DENTAL SURGERY has been developed using 64 graduate attribute statements in six domains (professionalism, scientific knowledge, patient care, dental profession, systems of health care and the society). Students entering the Melbourne DOCTOR OF DENTAL SURGERY must therefore have the aptitude to achieve these attributes during the course in readiness for progression to independent practice.</p>
<p>The Melbourne Dental School welcomes applications from students with disabilities. It is University and Faculty policy to take all reasonable steps to minimise the impact of disability upon academic study. Appropriate adjustments will be made to enhance the participation of students with a disability in the dental course. A prospective student with a disability is advised to discuss with Student Equity and Disability Support any issues related to his or her ability to successfully meet all the course and subsequent registration requirements.</p>
<p>All students of the DOCTOR OF DENTAL SURGERY must possess the intellectual, ethical, physical and emotional capabilities required to participate in the full curriculum and to achieve the levels of competence at graduation required by the faculty and the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation agency.</p>
<p>A student with a disability may be asked to provide independent medical or other clinical assessments of the disability and its possible impact on the ability of the student to successfully complete the course, before being accepted into the course. This statement would be treated in confidence with only those on the admissions committee and the Student Equity and Disability Support having access to the document.</p>
<p>Deliberate misinformation about the student’s ability to successfully complete the course will be regarded as unprofessional practice and treated as such.</p>
<p>While the Melbourne Dental School will make reasonable adjustments to minimise the impact of a disability, all students must be able to participate in the program in an independent manner. It is not reasonable for students to use an intermediary as an adjustment to compensate for a disability impacting on any of the five categories. In the clinical environment there is a primary duty of care to the patients and the needs of students cannot compromise this. It is expected that all students will be able to participate fully in all classroom based learning activities and to successfully fulfil the self-study requirements of the course. The presence of a disability will not automatically entitle the student to preferential treatment in clinical place allocation.</p><p class="last-updated">Last updated: 31 January 2024</p><h2>Assessment</h2><div class="assessment-table"><table class="assessment-details"><thead><tr><th>Description</th><th>Timing</th><th>Percentage</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p> 1 x assignment on Current Issues in Health Care </p><ul><li>1000 words</li></ul></td><td>October</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td><p> 1 x assignment on Population Oral Health </p><ul><li>1000 words</li></ul></td><td>July</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td><p> 1 x on-line assignment in communication skills </p><ul><li>1000 words</li></ul></td><td>To be completed by May</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td><p> 4 MCQ tests related to dental materials CALs </p><ul><li>40 minutes (each)</li></ul></td><td>Completed by mid-year</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td><p> Submission of 4 written assignments from Dental Materials practical work </p><ul><li>400 words (each)</li></ul></td><td>Completed by mid-year</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td><p> Radiology practical log books </p></td><td>Throughout the teaching period</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td><p> Continuing assessment on removable prosthodontics laboratory sessions </p></td><td>Throughout the teaching period</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td><p> 1 x practical examination on Infection Control in the clinic before entering clinical practice </p><ul><li>30 minutes</li></ul></td><td>September</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td><p> 1 x class test on Infection Control before entering clinical practice</p><ul><li>40 minutes</li></ul></td><td>September</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td><p> Assessment of clinical practice </p></td><td>Throughout the teaching period</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td><p> 1 x written exam on Population Oral Health, Current Issues in Health Care and Communication Skills, Law and Ethics in Dentistry and Behavioural Science</p><ul><li>2 hours</li></ul></td><td>End of the teaching period</td><td>15%</td></tr><tr><td><p> 1 x written examination on Radiography and Radiology; Infection Control; and Patient Assessment and Management</p><ul><li>2 hours</li></ul></td><td>End of the teaching period</td><td>15%</td></tr><tr><td><p> 1 x written exam on Dental Materials, Conservative Dentistry, and Removable Prosthodontics </p><ul><li>2 hours</li></ul></td><td>End of the teaching period</td><td>15%</td></tr><tr><td><strong style="color: #ea4f62;">Hurdle requirement:</strong> Satisfactory standard in Professional Behaviour</td><td>Throughout the teaching period</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><strong style="color: #ea4f62;">Hurdle requirement:</strong> 75% attendance at Lectures; 100% attendance at Seminars/Tutorials (including Computer Assisted Learning [CAL]) and Practical Classes (including Computer Assisted Learning [CAL] &amp; Laboratory Sessions)</td><td>Throughout the teaching period</td><td>N/A</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="assessment-description"></div><p class="last-updated">Last updated: 31 January 2024</p><h2>Dates & times</h2><ul class="accordion"><li class="accordion__visible"><div class="accordion__title">Year Long (Extended)</div><div class="accordion__hidden"><table class="zebra contact_details"><tbody><tr><th>Principal coordinator</th><td>Andre Priede</td></tr><tr><th>Mode of delivery</th><td>On Campus (Parkville)</td></tr><tr><th>Contact hours</th><td></td></tr><tr><th>Total time commitment</th><td>515 hours</td></tr><tr><th>Teaching period</th><td>29 January 2024 to  1 November 2024</td></tr><tr><th>Last self-enrol date</th><td> 9 February 2024</td></tr><tr><th>Census date</th><td>31 May 2024</td></tr><tr><th>Last date to withdraw without fail</th><td>20 September 2024</td></tr><tr><th>Assessment period ends</th><td>15 November 2024</td></tr></tbody></table></div></li></ul><h2>Time commitment details</h2><p>275 contact hours (indicative), 240 non-contact hours (indicative)</p><h2>What do these dates mean</h2><p>Visit <a title="this webpage" href="https://students.unimelb.edu.au/your-course/manage-your-course/subject-enrolment/enrolling-in-subjects?in_c=sinfo-enrolment-key-dates%7Csource=handbook%7Cmedium=web%7Ccontent=keydates#enrolment-requirements-and-key-dates">this webpage</a> to find out about these key dates, including how they impact on:<br><br></p><ul>
