<p>This subject gives students in the Master of Engineering (Software) their first experience in analysing, designing, implementing, managing and delivering a small software engineering project. The aim of the subject is to give students an understanding of the major phases of software development, what each phase requires and how that phase fits into the overall engineering process. The subject also aims to give students an understanding of the importance of analysis, design, quality assurance activities and management activities within a software engineering process and to underpin the practical aspects of the management, analysis, design and validation subjects within the degree.</p>
<p><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT<br></strong></p>
<p>Students will work in teams to conceive, analyse, design, implement and test a non-trivial software system for an external client. A key part of the project is for students to develop and manage a repeatable process in order to deliver a quality software product Workshops will explore the application of theory to your project and include selected topics drawn from: requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing and software project management relevant to the phase of the project that students are currently working on.</p>
<p>This subject has been integrated with the Skills Towards Employment Program (STEP) and contains activities that can assist in the completion of the Engineering Practice Hurdle (EPH).</p>

Specific timing of artefacts is dependent on the team's project plan, to be defined in coordination with their supervisor.</p>
<p>80% of each student's mark will be made up from a team mark. All team members will receive the same team mark, unless there are exceptional circumstances to warrant individual marking.</p>
<p><br>A team’s mark consists of the following components.</p>
<p>1. The engineering analysis, design, release and process-related documentation, requiring approximately 65-70 hours (50%) and including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A project management component assessing the team’s ability to manage a repeatable process</li>
<li>An analysis and design component assessing the team’s ability to apply software engineering principles and techniques to the development of a software system</li>
<li>A test planning component assessing the team’s ability to apply software engineering knowledge of validation and verification</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Final release of Software, in week 12, requiring approximately 35-40 hours (30%), that assesses the team’s ability to develop a non-trivial software system using software engineering principles and techniques.</p>
<p>3. 20% of each student's mark will be based on their individual contribution to the project, assessed on the same quality criteria as points 2 and 3.</p>
<p>A component of each submission addresses each of the Intended Learning Outcomes (ILO's). ILO's 1, 2 and 4 are specifically addressed by the final release (item 2).<br>ILO 3 is specifically addressed via the project management component of item 1.</p>
<p>All students are expected to participate in team meetings and workshops and contribute towards analysis and process related engineering documentation, coding and other team activities. Each student is expected to spend around 120 hours during the semester for project activities.</p>

<p>The philosophy behind the subject is that students learn software engineering by ‘<em>doing it</em>’. The software engineering project provides a realistic learning environment typically with an external client that wants to use the software.</p>
<p>Each student team is assigned a supervisor who acts as a mentor and guide throughout the project. Teams meet with their supervisor regularly to monitor progress and to discuss issues that arise during the project. The interaction between the student team and the client often raises issues that provide the topics for workshops and supervisor meetings.</p>
<p>The subject comprises one lecture and one two-hour workshop per week. Lectures are used to coordinate the teams, deliver software engineering theory and practice relevant to the stage of the project reached, and to share experiences between the teams. Workshops are used to discuss issues raised within the project, translate theory to practice relevant to the stage of the project reached and to share experiences.</p>
<p><strong>INDICATIVE KEY LEARNING RESOURCES</strong></p>
<p>The subject is administered through the University’s Learning Management System (LMS). Templates for the various artefacts, guidelines on engineering processes and links to software engineering tools are available through the LMS. A standard development environment is provided that includes programming languages, libraries and development tools is provided to the students and is available on most engineering computers.</p>
<p><strong>CAREERS / INDUSTRY LINKS</strong></p>
<p>The software industry is expanding and along with it the demand for software engineers that are capable of the analytical and management skills beyond programming. The industry is also changing in the nature of the projects being undertaken with many software engineers now working in multidisciplinary project teams. The skills and experience gained in this subject are valued by employers and are often seen as a necessary grounding for a career in software and technology related industries.</p>
<p>The subject uses external clients from outside of the Department and thus seeks to expose students to the types of environments in which software engineering projects take place. Guest lectures by are also given to highlight aspects of industrial practice and to expose students to the practical aspects of software engineering.</p></div></li><li class="related accordion__visible"><div class="accordion__title">Related Handbook entries</div><div class="accordion__hidden"><p>This subject contributes to the following:</p><table class="zebra" data-sortable=""><thead><tr><th scope="col">Type</th><th scope="col">Name</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Specialisation (formal)</td><td><a href="/2024/components/mc-eng-spec-14">Software</a></td></tr><tr><td>Specialisation (formal)</td><td><a href="/2024/components/mc-eng-spec-15">Software with Business</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></li><li class="community-access accordion__visible"><div class="accordion__title">Available through the Community Access Program</div><div class="accordion__hidden"><h3>About the Community Access Program (CAP)</h3><p>This subject is available through the <a href="https://futurestudents.unimelb.edu.au/courses/single_subject_studies">Community Access Program</a> (also called Single Subject Studies) which allows you to enrol in single subjects offered by the University of Melbourne, without the commitment required to complete a whole degree.</p><p>Entry requirements including prerequisites may apply.
