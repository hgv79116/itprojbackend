<p>It begins with a focus on international frameworks resulting from treaties developed by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the United Nations (UN) human rights system. It then examines the influence of these systems and comparative laws in several national and regional contexts.</p>
<p>The aim will be to provide a critical examination of the scope and operation of equality and decent work law at international, transnational and national levels and an introduction to comparative doctrinal and policy analysis.</p>
<p>Principal topics will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analysis of the roles, framework and key features of international treaties and conventions relating to work in both general (human rights) and specific (ILO) contexts, with a particular focus on Conventions relating to equality and decent work;</li>
<li>Consideration of debates about the meaning of equality, discrimination, freedom of association, decent work, fair trade and other contested concepts such as choice and responsibility;</li>
<li>Consideration of the key features of equality and employment law in key legal systems, including the European Union, major common law jurisdictions, and China, with a view to contrasting different approaches to these key concepts;</li>
<li>Consideration of the implementation of law in relation to equality and decent work and the uneven progress in the countries analysed resulting from different social, political and economic environments;</li>
<li>Examination of the role of transnational governance, such as private corporate codes and trade agreements in giving effect to equality and decent work; and</li>
<li>Exploration of possible future directions for better protection of equality and decent work.</li>
