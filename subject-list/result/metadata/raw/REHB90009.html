Students will be exposed to theoretical principles and practical applications of selected technologies. Students will critically appraise selected innovation and emerging technologies using a scientific approach in order to consolidate their understanding of the key elements that determine feasibility, safety and utility. This will develop an understanding of the processes involved in integrating innovative and emerging technologies into their clinical practice to provide information that is measurable and meaningful to their patients, healthcare insurers and providers. Students will be required to develop a proposal for implementation of an emerging technology to measure human performance or functional outcome. Moreover, students will explore existing or emerging platforms (e.g. hardware) and infrastructure (e.g. resources) that are required to support such an endeavour.</p>
<p>Stream details:<br>Students will choose two from three modules that best meets their learning interests and/or practice needs. These modules are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The clinical practice module will cover the role of new and emerging technologies that could be used to support accurate diagnosis, assessment and evaluation of efficacy of interventions.</li>
<li>The human performance module will cover the role of new and emerging technologies that could be used to facilitate analysis and measurement of human movement for the purposes of enhancing performance (i.e., sports, leisure and workplace) and screening for factors that may contribute to injury.</li>
<li>The research module will cover the underlying principles of critically appraising scientific research that has implemented new and emerging technologies to assess and quantify pathological and healthy human performance.</li>
