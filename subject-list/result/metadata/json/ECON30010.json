Topics include game theory and oligopoly, economics of information, behaviour under uncertainty and general equilibrium analysis.</p>"

        "Apply thorough economic reasoning to shed light on ongoing policy debates;",
        "Identify and analyse problems that arise from imperfect information including the phenomenon of adverse selection and the principle-agent problem;",
