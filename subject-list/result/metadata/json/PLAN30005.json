        "<p>The focus of this capstone studio is on planning the development and/or redevelopment of a precinct-scale urban site. Students will undertake site analysis, visioning, detailed concept planning and implementation considerations that together lead to the creation of a precinct structure plan or an urban design and planning framework.</p>",
        "<p>This capstone studio provides students opportunities to consolidate, extend, and apply the theories and skills acquired in the fields of urban design and urban planning. The learning process is student-driven, involving authentic project sites that offer real-life complexities and challenges. Both group and individual tasks are incorporated in the subject curriculum. Presentation and critic sessions are organised regularly to sharpen student\u2019s oral, visual, and written communication skills.</p>",
