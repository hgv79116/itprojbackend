    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will explore the development of modern architecture and urbanism during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It will include the sources and development of the modern movement as well as reactions to it encompassing post modernism, deconstruction and critical regionalism.  It will explore changes in politics and society reflected in the theorising, design and experience of cities and buildings, including their planning, spatial organisation, aesthetics and new building types as well as materials, technologies and modes of production.  Particular attention will be paid to the dynamic relationships between modernity, modernism and globalisation, and varied means and media for researching and communicating architectural history and theory knowledge. </p>"
