    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides an introduction to the construction of buildings with an emphasis on residential and multi-unit residential low-rise construction. The key functions and performance requirements for the main elements are discussed in relation to material selection, structural design and construction methods. The aim here is to expose students who are coming into the construction program without a cognate degree to appreciate how construction techniques, contemporary practice, building legislation, developments in sustainable design principles, advancements in materials technology are interlinked and all come together to influence the construction of buildings. The subject also includes an introduction to services within a residential context, and discusses various topics related to building pathology and maintenance.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Incidental costs</strong></p>",
        "<p>Students will be required to purchase personal protective equipment (steel-toed boots, hard-hat, hi-vis vest and safety goggles); cost approx. $90 to $120 per person. Students may use equipment from a previous subject if these are in good working condition.</p>"
