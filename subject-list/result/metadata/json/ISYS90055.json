        "<p>Outsourcing has become a routine part of management, yet it remains far from easy. In general, the concept of using external organisations (whether domestic or offshore) is considered an efficient and logical way to get things done, and is indeed widely accepted in many sectors of the economy. However, the learning curve is significant, it involves considerable hard work by both parties on a daily basis, and the results are highly dependent on the capabilities of the organisations involved. This subject focuses on the crucial activities that make a difference between success and disappointment.</p>",
        "<p>Students who have a weighted average mark of at least 75% in the Master of Information Systems have the option to complete the on-line Advanced Elective ISYS90092 Outsourcing and Contracting instead of ISYS90055 Managing IT Outsourcing.</p>",
