        "<p>Wellbeing Coaching examines the relationship between coaching psychology, wellbeing science and the philosophies that underpin these. In the context of a growing desire for wellbeing cultures to be developed, there is also a need to identify and apply clear processes to navigate and organize change with wellbeing in mind; and a coaching approach can significantly contribute to this.</p>",
        "<p>Students will be introduced to methodologies traditionally used within coaching and positive psychology research. They will develop skills in critically reading and engaging with the literature to identify effective coaching methods in diverse contexts such as within organisations, health and sport. Key critiques and debates in the fields of coaching and the psychology of coaching will be examined, drawing on a range of disciplinary perspectives to identify the evidence for effective practice. Students will be introduced to contemporary views and approaches in the field of coaching by leading practitioners and scholars, with consideration of implications for research and practice. Students will build skills in applying the science of wellbeing in their coaching and how different coaching approaches can impact organisational wellbeing and culture.</p>"
