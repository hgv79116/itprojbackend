        "<p>Most business leaders understand that regardless of the industry, delivering a relevant and reliable customer experience is critical to overall business performance. This subject will focus on what an organisation can do to support or deliver customer experiences for enhanced brand loyalty and organisational success. <br/>Topics will focus on managing the human, digital and/or physical touchpoints which make up each stage of the customer journey - pre-purchase, purchase and post-purchase- including the quality and value (e.g., cognitive, emotional, sensorial, social, etc ) the touchpoints provide. <br/>Subject matter will also encompass how a business can manage the contextual factors that impact the customer experience such as servicescapes; the behaviour of front-line staff and other customers; including the customer\u2019s own ability and desire to co-create value. Finally, the principles and theories behind how a business can bounce back and effectively recover when experiences go wrong will be provided.</p>"
