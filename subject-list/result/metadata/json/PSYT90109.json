        "<p><span>Students will complete a research project related to the youth mental health field. With the ongoing support and guidance of a supervisor, students will build on the literature review and research proposal they completed in PSYT90120 Youth Mental Health Research Methods by conducting a research project. The project may include a systematic review, meta-analysis, a narrative review, a quantitative analysis of secondary data, a program evaluation, or a qualitative research study. Students will produce a final 8000 word research report of between 46000 to 8,000 words that is suitable for submission for publication in a peer-reviewed journal, which is intended to equip them with a viable pathway to a PhD in the youth mental health field.</span></p>"
