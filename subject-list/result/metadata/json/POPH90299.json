    "overview": [
        "<p>The increased recognition of the complex, dynamic, interdisciplinary and multi-purpose nature of healthcare environments, calls for a deeper and more critical understanding of its key dimensions (physical workspaces design, virtual work-spaces and leadership &amp; management practices). There is increasing evidence of the effects of healthcare environments on healthcare staff work (clinical and non-clinical), satisfaction, productivity, performance and health and wellbeing. Hence this subject focuses on how Healthcare Environments can better support the healthcare workforce using evaluations.</p>",
        "<p>Although healthcare environment evaluation approaches and tools exist, engagement in existing evaluation approaches is limited, and the utilisation of evaluation findings in healthcare environment decision-making is variable. The subject content draws upon the fields of health program evaluation, work environmental evaluation, building design evaluation, and environmental psychology.</p>",
        "<p>This Intensive Subject will run over 4 days over an 8 week period to enable students time between each day to build new knowledge and skills and to complete assessments as required.</p>",
        "<p>To optimise student experiential learning opportunities, the subject adopts a modified flipped classroom approach, where: 1) students prior to lectures view and reflect upon videos on key current debates on Healthcare Environment Evaluation by academics, industry partners and healthcare practitioners; and 2) students engage with and experience subject content with tutorials focused on \u2018<em>What makes collaborative healthcare environments work?</em>\u2019, providing real-world insights into healthcare environment evaluation. Exemplars of healthcare environments will be studied from settings such as acute care, aged care and primary community care settings.</p>",
        "<p>This interdisciplinary intensive subject is led and coordinated by the Melbourne School of Population and Global Health. It will be available to graduates undertaking non-design and design courses to build their skills and knowledge to plan, design, conduct and utilise healthcare environment evaluation approaches in diverse multi-purpose healthcare settings.</p>"
