        "<p>How do gender and feminism operate in the world today, and what are their possible futures? Indeed, do these concepts have a future? This subject examines feminist theory and activism and presents perspectives on sex and gender that focus on inequalities across key sites, such as the family, work, religion, cultural representation and rights. It traces two competing traditions in feminist visions of the future of sex and gender \u2013 reform and revolution. From anarchist activism and sex and gender \u2018wars\u2019, to Islamic feminism, \u2018girl boss\u2019 and lean-in feminisms, we highlight the range of feminist theories and tactics alongside important ongoing tensions between universalism and difference in gendered experience.  Covering the first to fourth feminist \u2018waves\u2019 as well as key debates between liberal, radical, queer, Indigenous and decolonial feminisms, this subject explores feminist efforts to organise and to develop visions of an equal future across everyday practices of genders and of sexualities.</p>"
