    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject involves the definition and development of an industry-related project, and develops skills in project management, problem solving and planning and reporting investigations. The topic involves or draws on a specific and defined industry issue, and may be developed in relation to a period of time spent in industry placement or previously or concurrently selected elective subjects, applying the knowledge gained in these subjects to a real resource-based industry investigative problem. The project may relate to an applied scientific, economic or sociological or managerial topic, and the work will involve close collaboration between student, academic staff and industry advisors.</p>",
        "<p>Students work interactively with a supervisor to define their particular project. Each student prepares a detailed literature review and project proposal that places their project into context and includes methodology and approach, and covers the relevant background. A pass mark in the proposal assignment is a hurdle requirement for continuation of the subject. This involves establishing base knowledge in the relevant area; definition of the issue; analysis of the approaches normally taken by industry to address such problems and the degree of success normally attained. A final report is submitted by each student and an oral presentation is presented at completion to an audience including industry members. These detail development of suitable investigative strategies and methodologies and the analysis of results or outcomes in a practical context.</p>",
        "<p>Students meet regularly with their supervisor for guided, interactive discussion on their projects. Students are required to attend/view online a series of seminars delivered on project design, management and communication strategies.</p>"
