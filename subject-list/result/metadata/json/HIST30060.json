    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject brings all students majoring in History together in a culminating experience involving the design, research, presentation and communication of a research-based historical project. The subject begins with a early semester conference on the theme and issues to be researched. Students undertake guided research individually and in groups and prepare a presentation and communication of that research, in essay, report, website, audio or video documentary, or other agreed form. The subject includes consideration and study of modes of innovative and imaginative presentation of historical knowledge to a range of audiences. Class time is also devoted to study of the context of the historical projects, of the different forms and functions of historical knowledge in the modern and contemporary world and to development of skills for use in the historical project. A final conference allows for presentation of some of the results of the projects and celebration of them and of the completion of three years of historical learning.</p>"
