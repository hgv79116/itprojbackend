        "<p>This subject is intended as an \u2018integrative\u2019 capstone course, and as such does not introduce to the students substantial new material; but rather, provides them with a vehicle for applying and integrating the knowledge and skills they have already acquired. In particular, groups of students will be asked to undertake an exercise that simulates the management of a firm in preparation for their transition back into the workplace. They will also be asked to reflect on an integrative activity they have undertaken during their degree.</p>"
