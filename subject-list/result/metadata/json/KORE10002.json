    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is a continuation of Korean 1, designed for students with some prior knowledge, or experience, of the language, spoken and written. Students will extend their knowledge of the basic structures of the Korean language and will learn to converse in different situations which are progressively less personal and more related to the world around them. In this subject, students will develop intercultural understanding through identifying and reflecting on Korean norms and customs from a comparative cultural perspective.</p>",
        "<p>In addition, a range of authentic media will be used to explore key themes in modern Korean society. By the end of the semester, students should be equipped with more sophisticated language and intercultural skills to be able to express and situate themselves within a wider socio-cultural context.</p>"
