        "<p><strong>AIMS</strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject aims to develop critical thinking skills essential for work in the chemical process and other industries. Students will learn by tackling ill-defined engineering tasks, learn to organise and prioritise tasks to meet deadlines and improve their analytical and written communication skills. They will gain an appreciation of the tools and resources used in the design of process plants. Their understanding of issues relating to project management and plant safety will also be deepened.<br/><br/>This subject provides grounding in chemical engineering process design and feasibility studies prior to the final design subject CHEN90022.</p>",
        "<p> </p>",
        "<p><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT</strong></p>",
        "<p>Students will conduct chemical plant feasibility and design studies through a series of assignments that analyse process plant feasibility, the sensitivity of process economics to external influences and consider the technological, market, environmental and other effects on project viability. Students will learn how to design chemical plants, including the necessary documentation, and consider control strategies for safe operation. Student teams will discuss tools and resources available for the design of chemical processes and the critical analysis of information sources. Issues relating to project and safety management will be discussed and professional-quality technical reports and oral presentations delivered throughout the semester.<br/><br/></p>"
