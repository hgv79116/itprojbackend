        "<p>Bioinformatics is a diverse discipline that draws on a range of technical areas and is applied to a range of biological problems. In this subject a series of case studies is used to illustrate the application of bioinformatics to biological, agricultural, and medical problems. These case studies will be directly based on current practical research and taught by the researchers.</p>"
