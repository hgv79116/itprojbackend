        "<p>Catalytic processes are ubiquitous in natural and synthetic systems. A firm base of knowledge on catalysis is an essential tool not only for students interested in synthesis but also those who seek a deeper understanding of biological and industrial processes. This subject provides an overview of catalysis. A range of catalytic processes will be discussed with emphasis on transition metal catalysis, organocatalysis and photocatalysis. Case studies involving biological and industrial processes will form part of the lecture series.</p>"
