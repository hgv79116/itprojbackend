        "<p>This subject has been assessed by Health Education Services Australia (HESA) as meeting the curriculum content requirements of the National Immunisation Education Framework for Health Professionals (National Framework).  Nurses who successfully complete this subject can practice as independent nurse immunisers in Victoria, NSW and SA. Nurses from states other than Victoria should refer to the Department of Health in the jurisdiction they wish to practice for information on mutual recognition of recognised immunisation programs and any additional conditions relating to authorisation to immunise independent of a medical order.</p>",
        "<p>The subject is structured around the four domains described in the National Framework.</p>",
        "<ul><li>The Global and Australian context for immunisation</li><li>The immune system and immunisation</li><li>The law, ethics and immunisation</li><li>Immunisation practice</li></ul>",
        "<p><strong>Optional clinical placement</strong></p>",
        "<p>Students who require clinical practice in providing immunisations to adults, children and infants may elect to complete a clinical placement with a suitable preceptor.  This placement may be in the student\u2019s own workplace (providing assessment requirements can be met) or a community venue such as a municipal council where nurses will complete the placement as a volunteer.  During the placement students have the opportunity to complete a logbook and undertake a competency assessment. It is recommended that students check the availability of placements before enrolling in this subject.  A list of preceptors is provided in the 'links to further information' section.</p>"
