        "<p><br/>This subject is intended to develop critical research skills required to conduct professional research within the field of Psychiatry. Students will formulate a research question with relevance to one of the areas of specialisation covered during their studies in the Master of Psychiatry \u2013 preferably an area they have undertaken a selective subject within and can arrange appropriate supervision for. An ethics application may be required from the student.</p>",
        "<p><br/>Students will discuss their chosen research topic with their supervisor, devising a research proposal and outline that will form the basis of their thesis. Students will review relevant literature in light of their chosen area of study and according to established research method(s) in preparation for writing and then submission of their minor thesis at the end of term.</p>"
