    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject builds on your knowledge of how biological modelling provides insight into complex biological phenomena. With a focus on mechanistic modelling and viewing biological systems as dynamic in nature, you will learn how to develop and implement \u201creal-world\u201d models, applicable to current open problems in computational biology. Advanced approaches to model-based analysis of data will be introduced, including Bayesian hierarchical modelling. Software languages and packages for modelling and statistical analysis (e.g. SBML and STAN) will be introduced. Motivating problems will be drawn from across the spectrum of biology from genetics to ecology.</p>"

        "In addition to learning specific skills that will assist students in their future careers in science, they will have the opportunity to develop generic skills that will assist them in any future career path. In particular:\n\n- modelling skills: the ability to abstract and generalise from observations of a complex system, providing an alternative perspective on the problem\n\n- numerical and computer simulation skills: the ability to design computer programs to solve models and test hypotheses\n\n- time-management skills: the ability to meet regular deadlines while balancing competing commitments."
