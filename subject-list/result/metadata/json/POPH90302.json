    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces students to health services research, that seeks to identify the most effective ways to organise, manage, finance, and deliver high quality care and improve patient safety. This kind of research is more concerned with delivery and access to care in contrast to medical research, which focuses on the development and evaluation of clinical treatments. The aim of health service research is to increase understanding of the process, mechanisms, and effects of health services for individuals, families, communities, and populations in order to improve overall health outcomes.<br/>This subject paves the way for students to undertake health services research or to further appreciate the functioning of health services in clinical, management or policy roles.</p>",
        "<p>Topics to be studied include the following:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Introduction to health services research</li><li>Multi-level health service financing and organisation</li><li>Data sources for assessing health care services in high income countries</li><li>Scope and design of health services research and identifying areas of need</li><li>Qualitative methods for health services research</li><li>Quantitative methods for health services research</li><li>Evaluating health services using case studies</li><li>Knowledge translation and stakeholder involvement</li></ul>",
