    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will enable students to explore the theory and evidence relating to high performance and optimal functioning across a variety of contexts. Students will reflect on their best possible performing selves by drawing on the academic literature and real-life experiences.</p>",
        "<p>This subject will analyse and review teachable skills and pathways towards high performance. Through inquiry-based activities, students will examine a variety of disciplines including, but not limited to, psychology, education, social sciences, organisational behaviour and philosophy.</p>",
        "<p>Though an experiential mode of learning, students will learn about a variety of theoretical and evidence-based underpinnings of performance and goal setting. Coaching skills are integrated into experiential activities that are designed to help other people develop performance goals and strategies. Students will work through work-integrated learning case studies to analyse the challenges of applying theory to real-world contexts.   </p>"
