    "overview": [
        "<p>User Experience (UX) means the way we respond to technology, including our practical, intellectual, emotional and affective responses. UX is widely recognised as a major determinant of successful technology outcomes, and it provides the design inspiration behind some of the most successful innovations in digital technologies that define the present era. This subject concerns the methods and techniques that are used to identify what characterises UX and how you can recognise, measure and evaluate it in a variety of contexts. This entails a deep understanding of the psychological and social theories underlying UX, combined with practical knowledge of the various industry methods and tools currently in use. In terms of practice, an emphasis is placed on learning the skills needed to design, justify and conduct appropriate evaluations, and the interpretation of findings. In terms of theory, special emphasis is placed on how to identify and evaluate the various facets of UX, across a range of social and work-based settings, and across a range of technologies.</p>"
