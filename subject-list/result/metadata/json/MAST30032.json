    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces the concepts of mathematical and computational modelling of biological systems, and how they are applied to data in order to study the underlying drivers of observed behaviour. The subject emphasises the role of abstraction and simplification of biological systems, where required details of the underlying biological mechanisms will be provided. Combined with an introduction to Monte Carlo methods for statistical inference, students will learn how to identify common patterns in the rich and diverse nature of biological phenomena and appreciate how the modelling process leads to new insight into biological phenomena.</p>",
        "<ul><li>Modelling: Deterministic and stochastic population-level dynamic models; and agent-based computational models will be introduced and studied. Indicative examples will be drawn from health (e.g. infectious diseases, cell tumor growth, developmental biology), ecology (e.g. predator-prey systems, sustainable harvesting, environmental decision making) and biotechnology (e.g. biochemical and metabolic models).</li><li><span>Simulation: Sampling based methods (i.e. Monte Carlo methods) for parameter estimation and hypothesis testing will be introduced, and their importance in modern computational biology discussed.</span></li></ul>"
