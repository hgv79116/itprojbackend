        "<p>There is increasing recognition around the world of the threats facing urban environments and their water resources. In many cities water demand is approaching or exceeding limits of sustainability, leading to increasing interest in alternative water sources, such as stormwater harvesting, wastewater recycling and desalination. At the same time, receiving environments such as urban streams and bays are threatened by pollution and erosion from stormwater runoff, or eutrophication due to discharge of poorly-treated wastewater. There is also increasing recognition of the importance of water in the urban landscape, and of its role in the welfare and health of humans.</p>",
        "<p> </p>",
        "<p>The concept of \u201cwater sensitive urban design\u201d (WSUD), also known as Integrated Urban Water Management (IUWM) has developed in response to these changes. It aims to better integrate water into the urban landscape, improving the sustainability and liveability of cities (for example through the sustaining of health urban vegetation), while securing adequate resources for growing cities.</p>",
        "<p> </p>",
        "<p>This subject reflects the integration inherent in WSUD. The course will teach you about the individual urban water cycle components (water supply, wastewater, stormwater, groundwater), but will primary focus on their interactions and integration, and particularly their interaction with the built and natural environment.</p>",
        "<p> </p>",
        "<p>The subject includes a mix of lectures and project-based learning, including a major project (broken up into stages throughout the semester), a full-day excursion and workshops involving leading WSUD experts from public and private industry. The subject will cover:</p>",
        "<p> </p>",
        "<ol><li>An introduction to WSUD (its principles, objectives, context within other urban planning and sustainability policy &amp; practice) in developed and developing countries</li><li>Water in the urban landscape, the urban water cycle and its component characteristics</li><li>Social, environmental and economic impacts of urban water management</li><li>Structural tools and techniques (conceptual design, operation, maintenance)</li><li>Non-structural tools and techniques</li><li>Choice of scales</li><li>Analysis methods (water balance calculations, water end-use analysis)</li><li>Lifecycle cost analysis and multi-criteria evaluation frameworks</li><li>Design tools and software (e.g. MUSIC, Urban Developer, House Water Expert)</li><li>Institutional and implementation issues</li><li>Integration between water and other urban design elements</li></ol>"
