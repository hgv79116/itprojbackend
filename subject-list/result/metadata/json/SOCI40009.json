        "<p>Writing is a practice which assists with developing ideas and arguments, and enhances learning. Writing is also a central academic, employment and life skill. This subject will support students writing practice.  The <em>Writing Sociology</em> subject assists students with learning the craft of writing clearly and concisely. This subject will be a supervised but self-directed writing opportunity. Students will identify a sociological topic with their supervisor. Students will then build and refine their writing for sociology, through writing practice, editing and peer presentations of their written work.  They will also meet with their supervisor to discuss their writing progress and receive written feedback.</p>"
