        "<p>This subject lays the foundations for applying a dramaturgical practice to the contexts of rehearsal rooms and the development of performance. This subject introduces the practice of dramaturgy through a series of workshops with leading dramaturgs, literary managers, performance-makers and writers. </p>",
        "<p>Guests outline their understanding of professional dramaturgy, and their approaches to their various roles and tasks as a dramaturg. In parallel, a theoretical framework is established through a series of seminars focused on readings and discussions on contemporary dramaturgical practices.</p>",
        "<p>This organisational and theoretical knowledge will be applied in context as a dramaturg in rehearsals on a Victorian College of the Arts (VCA) Theatre undergraduate production (or equivalent).</p>"
