        "<p><span>After completion of this subject, students will have the knowledge to perform and interpret clinical arterial and venous vascular ultrasound and will develop a good ability in writing interpretive reports. Students will have interpreted and written a report on 10 ultrasound studies of a wide range of commonly encountered vascular pathology. Students will also have the knowledge in how to use ultrasound to perform ultrasound-guided percutaneous arterial and venous cannulation. </span></p>"
