    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject explores the theoretical paradigms, and the political, economic and social determinants of psychosocial practice in the field of oncology. Advances in cancer care, and the relevance of these in relation to life stresses and quality of life, have resulted in the increased importance of psychosocial issues on assessment, intervention and recovery. The subject will include the impact of cancer on the developmental stage of the individual, including family and interpersonal relationships, as well as issues related to survivorship and the management of cancer as a chronic illness. Professionals working in multidisciplinary cancer care teams are in a unique position to respond to the needs of people who have been diagnosed with cancer and their carers. This subject aims to strengthen their capacity to respond effectively and appropriately from a psychosocial service perspective.</p>"
