Psychoanalytic theory, systems theory, family theory and cognitive behavioural theory will be woven in when and as they relate to counselling practice. There will be ample opportunity to practise counselling through structured role plays within the tutorials and video role plays at separate times and to experience what it is like for the client in a variety of contexts and situations. Students will be encouraged to bring their own examples to work with within the tutorials.</p>"
