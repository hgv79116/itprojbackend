    "overview": [
        "<p>A knowledge of appropriate methods for management of our soils is vital for sustainable food production and environmental health. This subject will provide students with a thorough understanding of key soil chemical, physical and biological processes to enable practical solutions to soil management issues at appropriate scales. The subject will discuss major soil management issues such as: carbon storage; soil acidification; salinity; erosion and sodicity, including soil structure and its maintenance; the use of fertilizers, including composts, biosolids, manures and effluents from intensive animal industries and processing plants; the use of soil testing for maintenance of soil fertility and; offsite impacts of management on air and water quality. The role of the soil microbiome in improving plant productivity and the role of soil organisms in improving soil fertility and promoting nutrient transformations will also be explored. Practicals and excursions will be used to demonstrate methods of soil survey and land capability assessment.</p>"
