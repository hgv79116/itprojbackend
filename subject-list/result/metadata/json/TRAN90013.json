        "Intercultural understanding: Translation and interpreting require the practitioner to be deeply engaged with two cultures and to understand how to mediate between them on behalf of people who do not share both cultures. Students will develop cross-cultural and cross-linguistic sensitivity",
        "Decision making: Translators and interpreters are creative decision-makers who need to draw on multiple sources of data to form judgments that are seldom clear-cut. They are prepared to defend their decisions and to revise them when necessary."
