    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is to enable optometrists to extend their abilities to evaluate the sensory and motor pathways of the visual system, both in the context of evaluating visual complaints themselves as well as gaining further knowledge of how visual and ocular motor signs may reflect a range of systemic conditions, particularly of the central nervous system. Because complaints related to these pathways may reflect problems arising anywhere from the anterior visual pathways to the higher-order visual cortices, optometrists should benefit from gaining a deeper understanding of the current state of knowledge of these pathways and their assessment.</p>"
