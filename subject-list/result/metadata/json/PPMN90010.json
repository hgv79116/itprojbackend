    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject, a capstone option in the Master of Public Policy and Management, will examine contemporary real-world issues in public policy making, public sector governance and public management in a variety of contexts. Using input from professional practitioners as well as independent research, students will draw on the expertise that they have developed during the MPPM and apply it in real time to a contemporary project. Working both in teams as well as independently, students will identify and formulate key problems, develop a set of alternatives to address them, evaluate the alternatives against a set of criteria and recognise the trade-offs between them. Students will address the political, as well as the empirical aspects of the problems, and will develop advanced analytical, research and report-writing skills.</p>"
