        "<p><em>Projects and the Environment Practicum </em>gives students an opportunity to explore how the law works in practice, with a focus on environmental and social issues as they appear through the stages of a major project, from finance to operation.</p>",
        "<p>Students will encounter and analyse these issues across multiple areas of law, including contract law, environmental law, property law, and administrative law. Students will gain familiarity with the roles and perspectives of the diverse multidisciplinary actors with whom lawyers work when developing (or challenging) a major project, including financiers, community groups, consultants, scientists, and regulators. Topics will be taught using a real-life central case study to explore relevant issues.</p>",
        "<p>Students will develop their communication skills, particularly oral communication and using plain English approaches to explain complex laws; gain expertise in reading and interpreting legislation; reading technical documents like environmental impact statements; and teamwork.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics will include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>sustainable finance,</li><li>impact assessment,</li><li>environmental licensing, and</li><li>judicial review of project approvals.</li></ul>",
        "<p>Selected portions of student work may be posted on a purpose-built website designed to assist the community at large to understand key issues and challenges related to major projects that may affect them.</p>"
