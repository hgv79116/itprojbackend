    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject readies the generalist classroom teacher for the teaching of Health and Physical Education. It does so by drawing on the skills of high quality classroom teaching and applying these in the conduct of Health and Physical Education, both inside and outside the classroom. While Health and Physical Education is an integrated Learning Area within the Victorian Curriculum, the subject is structured via two parallel paths, taken by all Teacher Candidates, one of which emphasizes teaching of the Personal, Social and Community Health strand, the other the Movement and Physical Activity strand. Both of these paths focus on unit development in order to situate the curriculum content in activities that are meaningful to the children involved.</p>"
