    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject focuses on how second/additional languages are learned and used in bilingual and multilingual settings. It introduces key theories and concepts that had a significant influence on our understanding about the process of second/additional language learning and language acquisition more broadly. Drawing on the key theoretical perspectives, this subject explores and discusses various individual, historical, and sociocultural factors that affect the language acquisition and learning process, together with implications for language teaching methodology and lesson planning. In doing so, it also provides opportunities for students to critically examine and reflect on their own language learning experience and to consider different pedagogical approaches for their current and future practices.</p>"
