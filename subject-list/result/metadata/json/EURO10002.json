        "<p>This subject introduces students to Europe through the prism of its biggest annual media extravaganza, the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC). This pan-European event attracts more than 40 participating countries and hundreds of millions of viewers around the world. The ESC offers a rich site for exploring many issues at the core of Europe today: the expansion of the European Union, the integration of Europe as well as the \u2018nation branding\u2019 of new participating states. Through a series of case studies, this subject will examine a range of dimensions of Europe, including language, culture, diversity, the national and the transnational, as well as issues of gender and sexuality.</p>"
