    "overview": [
        "<p><span>After completion of this subject, students will have the knowledge to perform a clinical ultrasound to help determine the common causes of shock and cardiac arrest (peri-arrest). The peri-arrest ultrasound examination builds on the extended focused abdominal sonography in trauma (eFAST) of the abdomen, heart and lungs to include assessment of non-traumatic shock and cardiac arrest including cardiac dysrhythmia, ventricular function and volume, pulmonary pathologies other than effusion as well as diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis of the lower limbs to assist in diagnosis of pulmonary embolus. Students will be able to write a focused ultrasound report. Students will have interpreted and written a report on 10 online peri-arrest ultrasound studies of a wide range of commonly encountered cardiac pathology.</span></p>"
