        "<p>This subject explores the types of music that constitute the soundtrack of our lives. We all experience music every day, but how deeply do we really listen to it?</p>",
        "<p>What critical faculties do we employ when we stop to think about our taste in music, and why do we choose to listen to what we do? Active listening, as opposed to passive hearing of music, is a key element in this subject. We will help you develop a range of critical skills that will allow you to think conceptually about music and therefore to understand and enjoy music at a deeper level.</p>",
        "<p>You will acquire a set of tools and a working vocabulary for discussing, describing and analysing music. You will be better equipped to discuss the music you love and talk about why, when, and how you choose to listen to it. You will be exposed to a wide range of musical styles, including popular classical, contemporary, jazz, and non-Western.</p>",
