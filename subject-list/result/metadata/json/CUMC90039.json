        "<p>Framed by the philosophy and practice of two-way/both way learning, Issues in Cross-Cultural Preservation provides students with knowledge and practical skills to contribute to the preservation of cultural material in their own and other cultures, informed by strong cross-cultural understanding, engagement and respect. This knowledge also enables students to respond to broader issues of cultural significance and cultural responsibility as practiced within cultures and as required when working across cultures. Knowledge in these areas will be built through an articulated delivery, which examines the history of cultural engagement in the region, current community and professional practices that support cultural preservation, the use of technological bases to support cross-cultural engagement and cultural preservation, and the deterioration mechanisms that are of concern within different cultures. Students will obtain a strong grounding in understanding the development, technology and threats to cultural material, and will build knowledge in cultural material and heritage preservation management, occupational health and safety, identification and documentation, professional and senior knowledge relating to cultural preservation and preservation processes, and disaster risks and responses. This subject will be taught as an intensive with some material available online and the opportunity for industry placement in the student\u2019s area of interest.</p>"
