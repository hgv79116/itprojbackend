    "overview": [
        "<p>Biomechanics, which relates structure and function in biological systems, is important in the understanding of human movement, and in the treatment of conditions affecting the musculoskeletal and neuromuscular systems. This subject introduces students to musculoskeletal biomechanics of the human body, with applications to the behaviour of biological tissues such as bone, cartilage, ligament and muscle during human movement.</p>",
        "<p>The subject will provide theory and practical exposure to human motion measurement and modelling of the joint forces and moments that actuate human movement. This subject will introduce biomechanics in sport and implant systems, including ageing, injury and associated musculoskeletal disorders. It will provide an overview of orthopaedics strategies for the treatment of end-stage bone and joint conditions and relate this to relevant mechanics for designing implant systems. </p>",
