    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject examines the politics of race, ethnicity and culture in Western democracies and Western political thought. Beginning in the history of Western thought and assumptions about race, ethnicity and culture, it quickly turns to the discussions of the 19<sup>th</sup> century around nationalism, colonialism and race. The majority of the subject then focuses on 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> century discussions of race and ethnic politics with particular attention on the range of approaches and theories of race and ethnicity used in contemporary political and social sciences. This subject is not intended to be a comprehensive study of these themes in any location but to expose students to the history and various ways race, ethnicity and culture are politically salient in Western liberal democracies. Topics may include (but are not limited to): nationalism and national identity, racism/racial inequality, immigration and minority nationalism, ethnic conflict, linguistic difference, whiteness, and Indigenous politics. Students will engage both the conceptual challenge of what race, ethnicity and identity are and, as an advanced-level subject, they are also expected to engage the variety of theories and methods used to understand these phenomena in social and political life.</p>"
