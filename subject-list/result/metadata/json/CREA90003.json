        "<p><strong>This subject has been designed and developed for online delivery and assessment only.</strong></p>",
        "<p>This <em>online </em>subject introduces students to the practices of planning, assessment and evaluation that form a reflective cycle and underpin evidence-based approaches to arts-based programs.  A range of existing methodologies from creative arts therapies research will be considered, across quantitative, qualitative and mixed-methods, and will include arts-based approaches.</p>",
        "<p>Students will engage critically with current practices in their field to develop skills and understandings that will support them to be reflective and effective arts practitioners. Fundamental to these endeavours is the concept of theory of change, with students learning to conceptualise what they are seeking to contribute with arts participants and how they will recognise progress towards desired outcomes.</p>",
        "<p>This theoretical orientation will assist practitioners to meet the needs of participants while also being responsive to imperatives from other stakeholders that may include funders, host agencies and family and community members.</p>"
