    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject examines the normal physiological function of body systems and students are introduced to applications of anatomy and physiology as means of understanding responses and adaptations to environmental and internal stresses and different types of injuries.  Students engage in discussion on the integrated responses of anatomical structures and physiological responses across the lifespan and how these translate to clinical signs and symptoms and relevant nursing interventions. The subject also addresses the human body\u2019s response to micro-organisms and infectious diseases.</p>"
