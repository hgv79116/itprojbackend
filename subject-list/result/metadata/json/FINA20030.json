        "<p>Students will outline a higher degree of conceptual aesthetic and practical ability in their work and establish a more consistent self-directed studio practice. Students will also explore and develop links between their studio practice and the history and theory of art. Through individual studio tutorials and forums, students will establish the ability to articulate and discuss their work and the work of others in a contemporary visual art context.</p>",
        "<p>The Professional Practice component introduces students to industry-based activities in a real-life professional setting. Students will develop regular visual artwork practices through application of effective time management strategies and maintain established foundations of sound occupational health and safety practices.</p>"
