    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will focus on understanding development research design and a variety of research methods for investigating development problems. The subject will also seek to build skills in assessing the evidence produced from development research, and identifying the strengths/weaknesses and validity of development research designs. The subject will give attention to the challenges of designing and ethically conducting research in developing contexts, and understanding of the various stages of research, particularly in identifying the most appropriate and feasible approaches for data collection and analysis. It will include sessions on qualitative research techniques, and a basic introduction to understanding and collecting quantitative data as well as mixed research methods. Students will gain insights into the debates between different disciplines on methodological approaches, and understanding the politics of knowledge in development research.</p>"
