        "<p>This unit provides real\u2010world, hands\u2010on learning about what it\u2019s actually like to start a company or carry out an entrepreneurial project in an existing organisation. This is a practical unit, not a theoretical one, and is designed to give students the experience of how to work as a team and turn an idea into reality. Students will talk to prospective customers to see if anyone is really interested in the product or service they intend to develop. Based on the feedback gathered, students will rapidly iterate their ideas to produce a scalable, repeatable business model. The overall intent of the unit is to equip students with a set of skills that will be useful throughout their careers, whether they are working in startups or in existing organisations.</p>"
