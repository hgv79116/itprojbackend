    "overview": [
        "<p>Australia is one of the world\u2019s oldest liberal democracies. This subject is an introduction to Australian politics with an emphasis on what makes Australia unique and how its democratic institutions have developed over time. The subject concentrates on formal political institutions, including the constitution, parliament, the executive, the bureaucracy, federalism and the High Court. But it also examines the role of political parties, the Australian electoral system, voters and voting behaviour, lobby groups, social movements and the media. We consider the benefits and limitations of the Australian political system in the face of major policy challenges such as climate change, asylum seekers, gun control, marriage equality and economic crisis.<br/><br/></p>"
