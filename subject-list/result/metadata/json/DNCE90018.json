    "overview": [
        "<p>Dance Science and Somatics is an emerging field of dance knowledge. In this subject students gain understanding of how to enhance their practice through the disciplines of physiology, biomechanics and psychology and the intersection of these disciplines with embodied and somatic dance practices.</p>",
        "<p>Delivered through studio labs, practical demonstrations and seminars, this subject brings body knowledge to the foreground within an interdisciplinary context. With a focus on safe dance practice that enfolds sensitivity, imagination and creativity this subject provides know-how and theory for practitioners to dance safely and enhance their performance within environments of creative risk.</p>",
        "<p>Together the somatic and scientific threads combine to generate an in-depth knowing of the mind-body and clarify each student\u2019s understanding of their unique physical and psychological self and patterns of moving. Students will develop the knowledge to optimise their physical and mental performance, avoid injury and work safely as dancers within diverse situations.</p>"
