        "<p>This subject demonstrates to you the benefits of undertaking marketing actions within a strategic framework, and will show you how that can be achieved. Marketing Strategy enables us to refine our vision, check its fit with our target markets\u2019 needs, focus our efforts on the most worthwhile opportunities, and see how best to realize those opportunities. There are three logical steps in this process: (1) Analysis, (2) Generating and Calibrating Strategic Options, and (3) Planning to realize chosen options. We will examine each of these in this subject.</p>",
