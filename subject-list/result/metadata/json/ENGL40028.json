    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject explores the greatest and most influential literary work of art of the twentieth-century: James Joyce\u2019s <em>Ulysses.</em> Through seminars and class discussion, we will embark on a close reading of the eighteen episodes of the novel, each of which has a distinctive style, structure and form. The subject will highlight the humour of the novel, its use of parody and play, as well as its celebrated deployment of stream-of-consciousness technique. It will assess Joyce\u2019s rewriting of Homer\u2019s <em>Odyssey</em>, as part of its \u2018mythic method\u2019, and how its elaborate textual and literary architecture tells one day in the life of a Jewish Dubliner more exhaustively and intimately than any other act of literary expression.</p>",
        "<p>It will also highlight the various contexts of the novel \u2013 Irish, European and global \u2013 and its deep involvement with the politics of its era, including nationalism, imperialism, and ideas of race and gender. Finally, this subject will locate Ulysses within development of the modern novel and the artistic, literary and intellectual revolution known as \u2018modernism\u2019.</p>"
