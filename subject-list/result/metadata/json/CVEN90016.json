    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces students to the structural design and analysis of prestressed concrete and timber structures with applications to multi-storey buildings and other infrastructures in compliance with the Standards. This subject will build on the knowledge from CVEN30009 Structural Theory and Design and CVEN90049 Structural Theory and Design 2, particularly on the fundamental behaviour of structural elements under flexural, shear and axial load.<br/>This subject will also expose students to emerging technology to achieve more sustainable structures. Students will also explore various techniques to evaluate a structural design from a sustainability perspective.<br/>Students who complete this subject are likely to find employment in design consultancy or concrete construction companies and work under the supervision of a senior engineer.</p>",
        "<p>The subject covers topics such as design of partially prestressed concrete beams; High performance concrete; Design against physical and chemical attack of concrete structures; Design of engineered timber structures, Design for low carbon emission; and Life-cycle analysis and circular economy.</p>"
