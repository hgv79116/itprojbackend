    "overview": [
        "<p>Spatial modelling and analysis underpins many successful management applications for our environment and society. Questions surrounding humans, natural environments, and the relationships between them are inherently complex and necessitate advanced spatial analysis skills to understand and solve.</p>",
        "<p>This subject will provide highly desired competency in geospatial modelling. These skills are sought after in the workplace, and are also advantageous for students planning further study or research. Here, students will not only learn spatial modelling techniques, but they will also gain a thorough understanding of how to use these methods to address complex environmental, physical and human geography issues. Students will learn to analyse spatial patterns, build their own models, and <a name=\"_Hlk536009242\"></a>relate observations to processes in natural and human environments.</p>",
        "<p>This subject builds on students\u2019 existing skills and knowledge in spatial analysis for geography. It covers advanced spatial analysis and modelling topics spanning geoprocessing, networks, accessibility, and making predictions relating to the environment (e.g. ecosystem services) or human activities (e.g. land-use change). The primary software used for this subject is ArcGIS, including the Model Builder functionality. Emphasis is placed on project-based learning through computer-based practicals and individual assignments where students build their own geospatial models to answer questions relating to physical, environmental and human geography. This subject is taught in intensive mode, centred around a 2.5 week teaching period beginning late November.</p>"
