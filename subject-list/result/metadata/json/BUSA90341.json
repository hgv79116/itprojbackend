    "overview": [
        "<p>Emerging trends in globalization and renewed emphasis on operations as a source of competitive advantage have led to organisational changes that focus on inter-functional coordination, often spanning several firms in the supply chain. This course discusses recent developments in manufacturing-marketing-supply chain linkages and studies operational decisions that make such interfaces efficient and effective. It explores inter-functional dependencies, sources of conflicts, and on effective managerial decision making paradigm. The course principles are based on the premise that an organisation can become globally competitive when all elements that comprise its supply chain network are efficient and decision making is coordinated across the chain. The course will present in detail issues related to market-led operations, managing supply and distribution channels, and methodology.</p>"
