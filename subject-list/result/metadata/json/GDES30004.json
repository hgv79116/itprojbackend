        "<p>This subject builds on the knowledge and skills acquired in the pre-requisite subject, aiming at further developing the student\u2019s critical and technical skills in the representation of design through drawing and model making.</p>",
        "<p>Students are introduced via lectures to a range of visualization precedents and in workshops to analogue model making, painting and drawing techniques.</p>",
        "<p>Scale models, perspective drawings and renderings are generated which can then be imported into the digital realm to be further developed. The outcome will be the beginning of a portfolio of images demonstrating the student\u2019s capacity to express design ideas fluently and articulately.</p>"
