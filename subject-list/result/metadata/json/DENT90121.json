        "<p>This subject comprises complementary didactic and clinical components providing students with necessary skills in the disciplines of oral medicine, oral surgery and special needs. Competency in the core aspects of the Medicine and Surgery in Dentistry subject is required. Student learning will include: the part of surgery that deals with the diagnosis and surgical and adjunctive treatment of disease, injuries and defects of the human jaws and associated structures; the oral health care of patients with chronic and medically related disorders; the oral health care of people with an intellectual disability, medical, physical or psychiatric conditions.</p>"

        "Understand the principles of oral infections not associated with the hard tissues of the mouth; the presentation and diagnosis of chronic and recurring oral mucosal ulcers, including recurrent aphthous stomatitis; the diagnosis and management of gingival swelling and pigmented lesions; the oral manifestation of a range of dermatology conditions; the presentation, diagnosis and treatment of oral mucosal malignancy and potentially malignant lesions; aspects of haematology important to oral mucosal conditions; the oral manifestation of important connective tissue disorders; and the diagnosis and management of patients with chronic oro-facial pain and temporo-mandibular disorder.",
        "Comprehend the extractions, the surgical removal of teeth, surgical management of third molars, management of medically compromised patients, the surgical management of unerupted teeth, haemorrhage in a dental setting, as well as medical emergencies.",
        "Understand the basis of Special Needs Dentistry including gerodontics and related medical issues with aging, disease and health, developmental disabilities, neurodegenerative disorders, management of endocrine diseases, transplant medicine and dentistry as well as palliative dental care and be able to understand the complexities of managing patients with a range of these issues. They should be able to clearly understand the link between general health and oral health. Students should be comfortable when confronted by special needs patients in both clinical as well as in aged care and Institutionalised settings and have a sound understanding of consent and ethical issues as they pertain to this patient population and know the procedures involved when patients are unable to consent for themselves.",
        "Understand the competencies required to prescribe medicines. Health professionals who prescribe need to be equipped with competencies which enable them to make prescribing decisions which maximise the benefits and minimise the risks of using medicines to maintain the health of individuals and the community."
