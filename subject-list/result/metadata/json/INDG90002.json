        "<p>This subject allows Fellows in the Atlantic Fellows for Social Equity (AFSE) program to examine the policy and political context of their social change project. The subject explores historical and contemporary policies that are aimed at addressing Indigenous inequality across Australia, New Zealand, the Pacific and other nations with Indigenous societies. It will interrogate and explore frameworks, strategies and levers required to effect social change in Indigenous affairs at political and governmental levels and in terms of national and global contexts.</p>",
        "<p>Fellows will gain insights that will enable them to develop a comprehensive understanding of the Australian, New Zealand and Pacific contexts, covering issues such as sovereignty, self-determination, and land rights. This subject allows students to describe the broader context in which their work sits, identify key stakeholders and their interests, and communicate critical aspects of their project to decision-makers and partners.</p>"
