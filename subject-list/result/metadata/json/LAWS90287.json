    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will provide students with an in-depth understanding of the legal rules and economic principles underpinning the review of mergers and acquisitions in Australia. Around the world merger law is topical, with concerns about increased concentration and acquisition of potential start-up competitors, particularly in the fast-evolving digital space. In this subject you will examine how the competitive effects of different types of mergers are assessed in Australia, including the circumstances in which mergers may be authorised. We will examine the processes involved in merger review, as well as the penalties for contravention. The subject will also examine proposals for reform of Australia\u2019s merger review laws and processes. As the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) continues to advocate for substantial changes to our nation's merger laws, this subject presents a unique opportunity to delve into the nuances of Australian merger law's current and potential future application. </p>"
