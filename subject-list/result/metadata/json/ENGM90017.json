    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides a unique opportunity for experienced professionals to develop and practice the management, coaching and leadership skills required to guide innovation projects and take the next step in their careers. Over the semester, participants learn about strategic and operational considerations in generating innovative products and services. They also develop the leadership skills to guide teams that are innovating.</p>",
        "<p>Two broad domains \u2013 innovation and leadership for innovation -- are delivered together as this subject, <em>Innovation Practice.</em></p>",
        "<p>In terms of innovation management, students will learn and facilitate the application of a human-centred design approach to an innovation project. Along with the team you mentor, you will refine a project brief, design research, conduct interviews, generate insights, create a problem statement, generate proposals that respond to that problem statement and then, select, refine, hopefully test, and finally pitch a proposal. Because you will be responsible for ensuring that the team delivers a good outcome, you will find that you need to develop a solid understanding of the human-centred innovation process.</p>",
        "<p>In terms of leadership, you will be in a unique position to learn how to become a great leader. Your team is likely to be ethnically and professionally very diverse. The project tasks will be well outside the prior experience of the members. Furthermore, we will not allow you to \u201cmanage\u201d the team. That is, we will not allow you to tell them what to do. You may only use leadership behaviours such as facilitation, coaching, teaching, and so forth. However, we will give you instruction and support to create a safe environment in which you can learn. Also, by writing a weekly reflection and giving feedback to a peer on their weekly reflection, you will learn mindfully and thoughtfully about yourself as a leader.</p>"
