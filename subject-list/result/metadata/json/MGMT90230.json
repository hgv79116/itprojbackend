    "overview": [
        "<p>The purpose of this subject is to lay the foundations of launching a viable entrepreneurial venture based on modern entrepreneurship theory and practice. The subject includes the provision of tools and methods to assist in market ideation and opportunity identification. First, all students learn ideation and opportunity identification through case studies. Next, students will translate their ideas into an initial proposal and develop testable entrepreneurial hypotheses. While doing so, students will recapitulate learnings from Prerequisites. At the end of the subject term, students will produce a pitch document and give a presentation.</p>"
