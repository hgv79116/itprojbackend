    "overview": [
        "<p>In this subject, students will learn surface and groundwater hydrology with an emphasis on engineering applications. Techniques for statistical analyses of hydrological variables and mathematical modelling of hydrological processes will be introduced for engineering designs and investigations. The subject will introduce groundwater principles and modelling. Students will also acquire knowledge of surface water and groundwater quality. The subject will lay the foundation for a later subject ENEN90039 - Advanced Hydrological Solutions.</p>"
