    "overview": [
        "<p>Youth is a period in which adult identities are shaped and through this society\u2019s institutions and cultural beliefs are either reproduced or remade. For this reason young people and their attitudes and actions fascinate and create anxiety for broader society. The sociological study of youth is also the study of broader continuity and change. This subject introduces central classical and contemporary sociological approaches as they apply to the study of youth. It locates young people's experience in a context of social change, investigating the ways in which employment, education, family, gender, social class, youth culture and geographic location shape the meaning of youth in different ways in the early 21st Century. It explores the new ways in which young people approach learning, work and relationships and examines the impact of the digital revolution, globalisation, and the \u2018Asian Century\u2019 on young lives. On completion of this subject students will have deepened their knowledge of the major sociological approaches to youth.<br/><br/></p>"
