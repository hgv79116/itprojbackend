    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is for students with very little or no knowledge of Arabic. Students will be introduced to the sounds of the Arabic language and to the letters and symbols of its writing system, start building their vocabulary and gain an understanding of, and the ability to use constructively some basic structures of the language.</p>",
        "<p>Vocabulary and grammar will be learnt and activated through working with texts affording students insights into Arab culture, at this stage concentrating on basic sociocultural matters related to some aspects of everyday living and social conventions. In the process, students will be aided by state-of-the-art textbooks, authentic materials, both written and audio-visual, and the interactive online program developed by Asia Institute staff.</p>",
        "<p>Along the way, students will learn to study the language actively and interactively, become audiovisual learners and develop learning strategies to enable them to eventually become self-sufficient language learners capable of independently engaging in the perpetual process of learning a language.</p>"
