        "<p>The AMSI Summer School is a four-week program hosted at different Australian universities by the Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute.</p>",
        "<p>This subject will give students the opportunity to attend subjects taught by eminent lecturers from around Australia, creating an opportunity to study areas of mathematical sciences and cognate disciplines that may not be otherwise available at the University of Melbourne. AMSI Summer School is an exciting opportunity for mathematical sciences students from around Australia to come together over the summer break to develop their skills and networks.</p>",
        "<p>Students can choose from a selection of available modules. No course within the AMSI Summer School program that substantially covers material available in existing University of Melbourne postgraduate Mathematics and Statistics subjects will be available. The School of Mathematics and Statistics determines the subset of allowed modules that University of Melbourne students can choose from.<br/><br/>This subject is only available to students enrolled in the Master of Science (Mathematics and Statistics) or the Graduate Diploma in Science (Advanced) in the Mathematics and Statistics stream.</p>",
        "<p>Information on modules available at each Summer School is available on the <a href=\"https://ss.amsi.org.au/courses-and-lecturers/\" title=\"AMSI Summer School website\">AMSI Summer School website.</a></p>"
