        "<p><strong>AIMS</strong></p>",
        "<p>This course will expand on the basic principles established previously in Solid Mechanics.</p>",
        "<p>Methods of three-dimensional stress and strain analysis will be extended to allow the student to obtain solutions using analytical and/or numerical methods. These will include the analyses of principal stresses and strains, three dimensional Mohr\u2019s circles, strain gauge experimentation and failure criteria. In addition, this unit will focus on plastic deformation of solids, including the analysis of residual stresses and the collapse load of structures. The responses of materials to fatigue and fracture, as well as their creep and viscoelastic behaviour, will also be explored. Finally, this unit will provide a number of examples of experimental applications of solid mechanics analysis based on modern research techniques.</p>",
        "<p>The goal of Advanced Solid Mechanics is to consolidate the solid mechanics principles presented in the student\u2019s Engineering degree, and the equip students with skills required to solve a range of engineering problems they have not seen before. In addition, this subject seeks to teach a number of modern research methods, techniques and skills by drawing on biomechanical research in the field of solid mechanics, and the major challenges in the field.</p>",
        "<p><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT<br/><br/></strong>The following topics, delivered through lectures, guest seminars, group problem solving activities, and tutorials, will be assessed:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Three dimensional stress-strain analysis (weeks 1-2)</li><li>Strength theories and yield criteria (weeks 3-4)</li><li>Plastic behaviour of materials (weeks 5-6)</li><li>Fracture Mechanics(weeks 7-8)</li><li>Contact (weeks 9-10)</li><li>Creep and Viscoelasticity (week 11)</li><li>Biomechanics (week 12)</li></ul>",
