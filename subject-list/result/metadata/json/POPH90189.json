    "overview": [
        "<p>An increasing global focus on program effectiveness and efficiency has brought renewed attention to the role of evidence in designing and implementing health programs. Students of this subject will engage with the discipline of implementation science, and will investigate a range of current theories and approaches to program design, including: Theory of Change; program logic models; logical frameworks; complexity theory; behaviour change theories; emergent design; participatory/co-design approaches; and approaches to scale-up.</p>",
        "<p>Facilitated by experts with applied field experience in program design and implementation in Australia and other global contexts, students will learn via practical, staged exercises to draft strategic program plans. A range of case studies on current health challenges and interventions will build students\u2019 knowledge and skills in evidence-based health program design and implementation.  Cross-cutting issues in program design will also be considered and applied to case studies, particularly the issues of participation and inclusion. Students will be asked to consider evidence requirements and real-world compromises in programmatic research and planning within Australian and other global settings.  This subject will equip students with the knowledge and skills to operationalise their program design skills through best practice approaches to the development of work plans, budgets, risk assessments, risk management plans, and contracting.</p>",
        "<p>Health Program Design &amp; Implementation is a dual delivery block mode intensive subject. This means that the assessable material is delivered through self-directed online modules that students complete over a two week period. The online modules offer flexibility in relation to the timing of when students complete them, or what hours of the day you may choose to study. However, allocated modules must be completed in time to allow effective participation in live interactive sessions that are linked with those modules. Live interactive sessions are held on six days across the two week period, in which module  material is discussed with fellow students and lecturers. Students may choose to attend these live sessions online or face to face. Students are expected to commit approximately 40 hours to learning each week, comprised of learning modules, reading, discussion board activities, group work and live sessions. This two week teaching period is followed by independent learning towards a major assessment to be completed over six weeks.</p>"
