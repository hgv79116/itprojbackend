        "<p>Students will undergo extensive research training with their own individually supervised research project in the field of biochemistry or pharmacology under the supervision of a member of the Department or affiliated institution, acquiring skills in experimental design, technical expertise, critical thinking, analysis and interpretation, and communication. Research projects will be offered in a wide variety of research areas allowing students to choose a topic that interests them. Students will learn how to communicate their science in oral presentations and thesis writing.</p>"
