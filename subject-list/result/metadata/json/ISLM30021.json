        "<p>The issue of gender in Islam has for a long time been a point of contestation both within Muslim communities in their country of origin and in the West.</p>",
        "<p>This subject will provide an entry point into these debates and look to give students a firm grounding of the key issues as they pertain to Islam and gender. It will begin with a historical exploration of the place of women in Islam and then an account of the key texts (Qur\u2019an &amp; Hadith) and the different ways that these are interpreted across the Muslim world to define the roles of men and women and their relationship with God. Alongside this, the subject will survey a range of key debates, such as Islamic feminism, gender justice, women\u2019s leadership, sexuality and gender identity.</p>",
        "<p>The subject will also include the exploration of Muslim masculinities and how changes in this space are impacting gender dynamics in Islam. </p>"
