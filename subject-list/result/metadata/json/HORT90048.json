        "<p>21st century urban greenspace management requires an integrated multi-disciplinary approach. This subject, undertaken in the final semester of the Masters of Urban Horticulture, provides a basis for students to integrate and apply the knowledge they have gained throughout the course to solve a real world problem.</p>",
        "<p>Guided by academic staff and industry representatives, students will research current local, national or international cases using a problem based approach to develop planning, design, management, data acquisition and synthesis, and communication skills. The subject will be structured around a project in which students will work in teams of 4-5 people to assess, plan and document appropriate solutions for problems associated with an urban landscape.</p>"
