        "<p>This subject will provide practical insights into the role of science and scientific thinking within business, and the successful application of this perspective, along with communication and business tools, to work environments. Students will be assigned to syndicate groups to address a practical industry challenge/issue which has been identified by industry. In addressing this task students will draw upon their discipline knowledge and the skills provided in the professional tools subjects. On commencement of the project, students will be required to spend a specific time in the business setting and to then maintain regular contact with the business, as well as the project supervisor, across the duration of the subject.</p>"
