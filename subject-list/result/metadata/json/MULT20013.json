    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces students to key social, political and environmental issues which are shaping contemporary Australia. It is ideal for international students, for students whose main area of study lies outside the humanities, and for students who wish to gain a broad understanding of the complex challenges facing Australia today. The subject is responsive to current debates in Australia, and issues it covers include the arguments about social justice for Indigenous Australians; immigration and asylum seekers; environmental concerns; social inequality; the relationships between men and women; Australia's identity and the impact of globalisation. Students are encouraged to develop their own analyses of contemporary Australia, using appropriate theoretical constructs, fieldwork, and a variety of sources. Lectures and tutorials draw on a range of materials including journal and newspaper articles, poetry and Australian films and documentaries.</p>"
