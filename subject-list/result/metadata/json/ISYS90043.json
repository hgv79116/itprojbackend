        "<p>This core subject introduces the concept of enterprise architecture (EA). The structure of an EA provides the framework by which an organisation can be understood. It introduces the fundamental relationships existing between various components of the EA namely: processes, information, organisational structure and enabling technologies. Consequently, many of the concept domains introduced in this subject are more fully explored in further core and elective subjects.</p>",
        "<p><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT <br/></strong></p>",
        "<p>Integrating business applications across business functions and companies provides large benefits to organisations. This subject has two primary themes. Firstly, it introduces EA concepts and frameworks that serve as artefacts of the business and also the process of creating an EA. Secondly, it looks at the implementation of the EA into the organisation and the impacts on the processes, information, organisational structures and applications employed by to enable the organisation to function. A final discussion covers the benefits, risks and critical success factors.</p>"
