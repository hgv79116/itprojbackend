    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will survey Earth\u2019s microbiomes, including the terrestrial, marine, extreme environments, urban/built/engineered environments and microbiomes in symbioses (e.g., human, coral, plants). We will explore the construct of a microbial \u201ccommunity\u201d, its constituent populations and diversity, and its interactions with inorganic and organic materials and processes (biogeochemical cycles \u2013 carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, etc.). We will look at approaches to microbial census taking, and key traits of cultured microbial groups. We will examine the scope and significance of the uncultured microbial majority, including the so-called \u201cmicrobial dark matter\u201d with respect to our understanding of evolution and the tree of life. We will investigate the role of viruses in the Earth\u2019s microbiomes, and the origin and evolution of microbial life in the context of Earth\u2019s biogeochemical cycles.</p>"
