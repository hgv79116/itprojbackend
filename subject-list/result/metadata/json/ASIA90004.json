    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject aims to advance fourth year and postgraduate coursework students' conception of the interdisciplinary field of Asian Studies. Students will deepen their understanding of this field through readings and discussions on societies ranging from Northeast to Southeast Asia to the Middle East. A critical and comparative outlook is encouraged throughout by way of contextually addressing a series of key issues confronting contemporary Asia as well as by exploring the utility of various available theoretical perspectives and conceptual tools in thinking about students\u2019 own research projects and interests. Students are expected to interact with each other and with the instructor in seminar discussions on the assigned readings and on relevant topics. Presentations are required, mainly in the last two weeks of the semester though some may be scheduled beforehand.</p>"
