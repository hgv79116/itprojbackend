    "overview": [
        "<p>Students work collaboratively in small groups to implement and optimize components in a modern communication system or network with the goal of supporting a targeted application. To meet this goal students will need to: determine system requirements based on the target application and additional constraints; propose and evaluate multiple solutions through theoretical analysis and detailed simulations; implement, integrate, verify, and iterate on their selected solutions. Lectures will cast content from prerequisite subjects into the context at hand and cover additional topics relevant to the task. Each student group is expected to demonstrate initiative and independence while pursuing the goal of designing and optimizing their communication system or network, with a key focus being that students learn through hands-on experience.</p>",
        "<p>Students will receive early exposure to advanced topics critical to modern communication systems, such as: source and channel coding, multicarrier modulation, multiantenna transmission, and network architectures and protocols. Successful completion of the project will require the student to draw upon knowledge, understanding, and skills learned in prerequisite subjects, which may include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Communication Systems \u2013 analog-to-digital conversion, signal-to-noise ratio, modulation and demodulation, bandwidth/power trade-off, error probability calculations, distortion, inter-symbol interference, pulse shaping, equalization, sequence detection, and synchronization.</li><li>Signal Processing - design and implementation of digital filters (low-, high-, band-, all- pass filters); ARMA systems; up-sampling and down-sampling.</li><li>Embedded System Design \u2013 system-level programming, operating systems concepts, real-time issues, and standard software tools.</li></ul>",
        "<p>Additional topics required for the assigned project may also be covered, such as: ideation, prototyping, and design practices; analog RF components; software packages for modelling and implementation; and the use of test &amp; measurement equipment.</p>"
