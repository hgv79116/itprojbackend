As well as tutorials on ophthalmic emergencies and anaesthesia, this  subject tackles many of the practical aspects of ECC including but not limited to: CPR, monitoring, imaging, cytology, nutritional support and technical procedures. Interpretation of cytology, clinical pathology, ECGs and radiographs are reviewed and techniques for jugular and arterial catheter placement, chest drain placement, oxygen support, feeding tubes are demonstrated.</p>"
