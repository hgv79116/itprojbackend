        "<p>This capstone project will provide the culmination of the Master of Data Science degree. It will apply the skills developed during the degree to a practical problem of relevance to science, industry, commerce or society in general. Students will work in teams under only general guidance from staff members. Students will complete diaries to log their work on the project so that the extent of their contribution to group projects can be determined. In the first part of the project students will complete a literature review and a plan for their project.</p>"
