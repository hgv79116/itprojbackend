    "overview": [
        "<p>High and rising inequality both between and within countries represents a global grand challenge with significant economic, social, environmental and health implications. This interdisciplinary subject introduces concepts and theories from population health, the humanities, sociology, economics, geography, criminology and education to explore contemporary and historical trends and debates. It will be delivered by scholars and eminent guest speakers from varied backgrounds and areas of expertise and focus on understanding causes, consequences, and potential means of tackling inequalities, inequities and injustices from a range of disciplinary perspectives. Students will gain insights into different disciplinary approaches to understanding and addressing inequality and be encouraged to reflect on the ways in which inequalities affect individuals, communities, societies and nations and on their own positions with respect to relative power, privilege and capacity for action.</p>"
