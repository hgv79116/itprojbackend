    "overview": [
        "<p>In this subject, students will learn underlying theory and applications of state-of-the-art positioning technologies. The subject first introduces the concept of positioning, addressing why localisation requires user-defined coordinate systems as a benchmark. An overview of global and Australian geocentric coordinate systems such as ITRF and GDA2020 is given, with a discussion on the Australian Height Datum (AHD). Distinguished from their associated technologies, the following positioning principles are taught: 1) direct observation, 2) time-difference of arrival (TDOA), 3) surveying resection otherwise known as angle of arrival (AOA), 4) spatial correspondence (e.g., fingerprinting), and 5) interferometry.</p>",
        "<p>The subject focuses on high-precision positioning technologies such as 1) Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), 2) surveying digital measuring systems, 3) Inertial Navigation Systems (INS), 4) Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) localisation systems, and 5) Laser-scanning and vision-based systems. The subject is of broad relevance to students with an interest in technology or to those specifically wishing to establish a career in engineering, mining or cadastral surveying, but is also relevant to a range of mapping, spatial, civil and communication engineering disciplines where precise localisation of digital sensors should be considered.</p>",
        "<p>In detail, the subject will cover coordinate transformations and conversions, high precision GNSS and trigonometric surveying, LIDAR and camera-based indoor positioning, optimisation of positioning solutions via least squares computations, precise levelling, and height determination.</p>"
