    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces students to the historical foundations and broad frameworks which shape the scope and dimensions of nursing. It takes a lifespan approach to key areas of practice, including child and adolescent health, aged care and mental health. Regulatory, legal and ethical frameworks that guide professional practice are examined. International, national and local politico-legal and economic factors that impact on the healthcare system and the sustainable provision of health services within in-patient and community settings are explored. Population health, health promotion and health literacy are considered within the National Health Priorities. Principles of cultural diversity and safety are explored. Emphasis is also given to the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations. Using experiential learning, students will develop general interaction and therapeutic communication skills that enable them to perform nursing assessments and engage in supportive interventions that demonstrate cultural competence and are appropriate to patient/client emotions, cues and educational needs. Students will gain an understanding of human development across the lifespan, theories of coping and adaptation, therapeutic relationships, and patient and carer perspectives. Throughout, students are encouraged to explore and reflect upon their own values and beliefs about health and illness.</p>",
