    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces students to the world of consulting through the eyes of practicing consultants. Guest consultants, drawn from leading international and local firms and academia, will introduce students to the ideas, theories and frameworks that are most influential and used in the industry. They will do this by introducing students to a major text that has inspired their thinking and consulting practice. Students will engage with the text critically to recognise its strengths and limitations. Students will also be exposed to how the consultants practically apply the concepts through demonstration case studies. Consultants will be drawn from representative functional areas, such as strategy, operations, human resources, marketing and sustainability.</p>"
