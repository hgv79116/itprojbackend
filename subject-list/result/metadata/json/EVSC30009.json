    "overview": [
        "<p>The transition to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions will involve a significant transformation of the global energy system. This will fundamentally change where energy is generated and how it is consumed. These required changes will have broad economic, socio-environmental, and geopolitical challenges. Such as, the uneven endowment of wind and solar resources in regions that may be rich in biodiversity, with or without large human populations, or existing transmission infrastructure. However, continuing to rely on fossil fuels also exposes nations, businesses, and essential services to geopolitical instabilities and social injustice. A systematic view is needed to analyse, predict and chart viable pathways for our energy transition.</p>",
        "<p><br/>This subject provides a capstone experience for the Environmental Science major specialisation in Energy Transition, while also providing a sustainability lens for discipline-focused majors in the energy space. This subject builds upon a fundamental understanding of thermodynamics, chemical, mechanical and/or electrical energy to explore the role of energy in nature and human society. Students will learn about the various forms of energy generation with their associated environmental and social impacts, and the degree to which the supply and demand of energy   must be transformed, in order to mitigate climate change while conserving biodiversity and sustainable economic development. Students will evaluate real-world decision-making problems, and develop the skills needed to assess and critique energy transition pathways towards a sustainable future.</p>",
        "<p><br/>The energy transition is also a key component of environmental, social and governance (ESG) of businesses. Students will learn from industry experiences and potentially present to an industry panel. </p>"
