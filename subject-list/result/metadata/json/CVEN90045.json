    "overview": [
        "<p>Project management provides an organisation with powerful tools that improve its ability to plan, organise and manage resources to bring about the successful completion of specific project goals and objectives. In undertaking this subject students will explore the principles and distinct technical skills of engineering management that are needed to implement a project. The subject is of particular relevance to students wishing to establish a career in engineering project management, but is also of relevance to a range of engineering design disciplines where design for the total life cycle of the product or infrastructure should be considered. </p>",
        "<p>Topics covered include key aspects of the management principles, project planning &amp; scheduling, management systems &amp; control and management practices to enable execution of the project in a timely and financially prudent manner.</p>",
        "<p>Note: This subject has been integrated with the Skills Towards Employment Program (STEP) and contains activities that can assist in the completion of the Engineering Practice Hurdle (EPH).</p>"
