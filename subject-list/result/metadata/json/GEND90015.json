    "overview": [
        "<p>This 1 week, face to face intensive subject draws on international best practice guidelines for measuring violence against women.  It is an applied research subject designed to equip students with skills to collect data or conduct research and evaluation with women who have experienced violence.  The subject will support students to understand the theory behind the research methods and develop appropriate skills to measure the prevalence, nature and extent of women\u2019s experiences of violence; and to evaluate prevention and response programs to inform evidence-based practice and support funding applications.  It will cover skills required to conduct and/or commission research in this sensitive area safely and ethically, thereby preventing further harm to families. </p>",
        "<p>Specific topics that will be covered include: understanding the different ways that data is collected to measure women\u2019s experience of violence including prevalence, reported incidents of violence, and qualitative reports of the nature, severity and impact of the abuse;  understanding the important standard co-variables generally collected in order to obtain a more complete picture of the women\u2019s circumstances; skills in conducting ethical and safe research in this area including recruiting, interviewing and post interview support; the strength of triangulating research to gain multiple perspectives; and realistic expectations of how to measure impact of a program and change in a woman\u2019s life.</p>"
