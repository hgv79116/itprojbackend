        "<p>In this practice-based subject the student writer undertakes a range of writing classes and exercises with the aim of developing techniques for the generation and structuring of original material for live performance; in working to a brief in diverse professional circumstances; and in evolving an individual creative vision.</p>",
        "<p>Students engage in frequent and fast writing practice using different forms of writing (e.g. narrative driven plot, montage, reaction, dream-writing, comedic, verbatim, poetic metaphor, adaption) and starting from different kinds of stimuli (theme, event, idea, visual image, live observation, character descriptions, imagination, existing play). The length of written pieces will vary from very short to medium length over the course of the subject.</p>",
        "<p>Focus will be given to explorations of form and content, and to new challenges to writing form and content provoked by international and Australian contexts and examples. Students will read and workshop each other\u2019s pieces and from time to time there will be master classes with visiting professional playwrights.</p>"
