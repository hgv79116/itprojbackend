        "<p>Mind, Brain &amp; Behaviour 1 provides an introduction to the psychological concepts, theories and neural mechanisms that explain how we sense, perceive, learn, think and remember. Students are introduced to the research methods used in psychology for answering questions and solving problems related to human behaviour. Students apply their knowledge and skills in a team-based project that addresses a contemporary problem and communicate their findings in a team-based presentation. They learn how to build an evidence-based argument and communicate this in an individual literature review or empirical report. </p>"
