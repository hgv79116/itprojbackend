        "<p>Mobile devices are ubiquitous nowadays. Mobile computing encompasses technologies, devices and software that enable (wireless) access to services anyplace, anytime, and anywhere. This subject will cover fundamental mobile computing techniques and technologies, and explain challenges that are unique to the design, implementation, and evaluation of mobile computing. In particular, this subject will enable students to develop mobile phone applications that take advantage of the unique sensing capabilities of mobile devices, their multi-modal interaction capabilities, and their ability to sense and respond to context.</p>"
