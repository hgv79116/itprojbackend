        "<p>This individual study based subject is a capstone option for the completion of the Master of Urban Planning. Students will be supervised by an academic throughout the research process. Discussions with a supervisor allow the student to obtain advice and guidance for completion of an independent study.<br/><br/>The thesis requires two consecutive semesters of enrolment:</p>",
        "<ul><li>The focus of the first semester is developing a research question, undertaking a literature review related to that question and proposing methods to answer the research question (which may require ethics clearance).</li><li>The second semester concentrates on the middle to final stages of research from the implementation of a research plan, to effectively interpreting and presenting results.</li></ul>",
        "<p>NOTE:<br/>The MSD Minor Thesis requires two consecutive semesters of enrolment. Students can commence the Minor Thesis ( ABPL90396 MSD Minor Thesis Part 1) in either Semester 1 or 2 and must continue (ABPL90397 MSD Minor Thesis part 2) in the following semester. Upon successful completion of the MSD Minor Thesis, students will receive 25 points credit.</p>",
