    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is Part 1 of the 50-point research project offered through the Graduate Diploma in Science (Advanced) stream in BioSciences. The subject involves laboratory and/or field-based experimental research in an area of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology or Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology. The research projects cover a broad range of research from molecular to population and evolutionary biology in micro-organisms, insects, plants and animals. The project will be based in the research group of an academic staff member in the School of BioSciences or an approved external supervisor, depending on the particular research project. The research project aims to develop a range of experimental and technical skills, a capacity to set goals and to design and plan experiments. The subject also provides students with skills and knowledge to interpret and critically analyse original research and enhanced written and oral communication skills.</p>"
