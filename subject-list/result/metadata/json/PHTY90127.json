    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides opportunities for students to engage with more advanced levels of musculoskeletal physiotherapy practice with an emphasis on manual therapy and sports physiotherapy. On completion of this subject, students will have further developed a range of assessment and therapeutic skills including manual handling, differential diagnosis, critical evaluation, clinical decision making, selection and justification of assessment and treatment. Advanced practice will also incorporate the identification, appraisal, synthesis and application of research evidence underpinning specific areas of musculoskeletal physiotherapy practice. Furthermore, students will understand the role of a musculoskeletal physiotherapist and a sports physiotherapist as part of a multi-disciplinary team. Advanced clinical reasoning and practical skills will be refined through facilitated practice with peers, masterclasses, clinical cases, practical demonstrations, and group tasks. </p>"
