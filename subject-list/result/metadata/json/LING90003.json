    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides an introduction to the range of approaches to research as practised in applied linguistics in three main areas: (a) research paradigms, or the philosophical assumptions concerning knowledge and ethical considerations; (b) research approaches, or the designs for research that includes quasi-experiments, ethnography, discourse analysis, and action research; (c) data collection and analysis techniques, that include surveys, observation, interviews, introspection, and verbal report protocols. Working with these topics and completing assignments will prepare students to design research projects and to critique research in the field of applied linguistics.</p>"
