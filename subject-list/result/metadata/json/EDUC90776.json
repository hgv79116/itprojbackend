        "<p>This subject will support Teacher Candidates to develop pedagogical content knowledge for the effective teaching and learning of the following mathematics strands from Prep to Year 6:</p>",
        "<p>Content Strand: Statistics and Probability</p>",
        "<p>Proficiencies: Understanding, Fluency, Problem Solving, Reasoning.</p>",
        "<p>Within this content strand, Candidates will analyse the development of key concepts in primary mathematics and identify critical progression points for children\u2019s learning. They will consider typical conceptions and misconceptions held by children, their likely causes, diagnostic tools to diagnose them and teaching strategies for changing them.</p>",
        "<p>They will review and critique resources for primary mathematics and examine tasks designed to achieve specific learning outcomes in these strands.</p>",
        "<p>Candidates will consider research evidence related to selected key issues of teaching Statistics and Probability. They will examine cognitive and affective characteristics of mathematics classrooms that encourage deep learning in these content areas and in the proficiency strands.</p>"
