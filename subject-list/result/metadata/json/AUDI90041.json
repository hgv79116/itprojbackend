        "<p>This unit focuses on problem based learning to build student competencies in working with complex, multifaceted clinical cases. The content will focus on a range of issues across the lifespan including neurological diseases, diverse cultural backgrounds, mental health, behavioural difficulties, pre-intentional and multimodal communication, diverse socio-economic backgrounds, adolescent development and health, aged care and hearing loss. Students will be required to integrate information from a variety of sources, apply knowledge acquired in previous units, address professional issues that arise during complex cases and communicate their ideas clearly and effectively in both written and oral format.</p>"
