    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will build on student\u2019s knowledge of the use of medicines commonly used in sports medicine in the context of recovery from injury and illness and optimising athlete health and performance. Content will include information on the therapeutic actions of medicines, their time course to action, interaction with other medications and the short and potential long-term impact on the individual.  Further, consideration will be given to how sport and exercise affects the absorption and action of these medications and the impact of prescribed (including injectables) and over the counter medications on athletes in and out of competition. Attention will be given to both the beneficial and deleterious effects of drug regimes. </p>",
        "<p>The subject will commence with a four-week module on standard nomenclature, foundational principles and theory of pharmacotherapeutics in sports medicine. Attention will be paid to use of medicine in acute scenarios such as anaphylaxis, injury, pain and trauma including concussion as well as chronic or diagnosed conditions such as diabetes, asthma and other cardiovascular, endocrine and metabolic conditions. In addition, obligations and procedures in accordance with the WADA code will be addressed.</p>",
        "<p>The use of pharmacotherapeutics in sport will be explored in the context of application to sports medicine practice, professional scope of practice, doping regulations, codes of conduct and ethics. Further complex scenarios will be examined with case studies involving athletes in competition and out of competition. </p>",
        "<p>Following the foundational module, students will select two from three modules that will explore and apply pharmacotherapeutics in sport in the context of three athletic populations: paediatrics &amp; adolescent athletes, female athletes, and performance athletes.  These modules are relevant to management of athletes of all ages and abilities, and also specifically relevant to three areas of practice specialisation. This fully online subject will be taught with the use of case studies, video presentations, selected readings, webinars and discussions with colleagues, as well as with assessment tasks. This subject can be taken as a single subject or as part of a Graduate Certificate in Sports Medicine, Graduate Diploma in Sports Medicine or Masters of Sports Medicine. </p>"
