    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is only available to incoming study abroad and exchange students in veterinary science. This subject continues across two consecutive study periods, with students first enrolling in Part 1 and then Part 2.</p>",
        "<p>This subject is undertaken as a series of 25 weeks of scheduled clinical rotations, internally within the University Veterinary Hospital and in external placements plus 20 weeks on extramural elective placements. The subject comprises 45 weeks of study.</p>",
        "<p>This subject addresses and assesses the five core learning domains of Veterinary Professional Practice:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Personal and Professional Development</li><li>The Scientific Basis of Clinical Practice</li><li>Clinical Skills</li><li>Ethics and Animal Welfare</li><li>Biosecurity and Population Health</li></ul>",
        "<p>The internal rotations include training in clinical disciplines such as general practice, small animal medicine, small animal surgery, equine medicine and surgery, production animal medicine, diagnostic imaging, anaesthesiology, small animal emergency medicine, specialty clinical disciplines and pathology.</p>",
        "<p>The external rotations include training in clinical disciplines such as veterinary public health, dairy cattle medicine and surgery, and shelter medicine and surgery.</p>",
        "<p>Extramural rotations may be taken in sequences lasting from one to five weeks\u2019 duration. They may be undertaken in approved veterinary practices in Australia or internationally, in government veterinary laboratories or other organisations, or in a veterinary research environment. A research project may be undertaken during extramural elective rotations.</p>",
        "<p>A Capstone series of lectures and workshops is delivered in November with reviews of topics that prepare students for transition to the workplace. Students are expected to attend Capstone unless they have a waiver from the coordinator. Waivers may be considered for students undertaking selective placements.</p>"

            "brief": "Additional detailsThis assessment statement applies to the entire enrolment across Parts 1 and 2 of the subject (i.e. VETS40022 and VETS40023 together).\nOverall assessment\nClinical rotations, extramural placements and electives; ongoing (100%)\nInternal and External Clinical Rotations (core and elective), Extramural Placements (100% of total subject assessment)\nContinuous assessment of performance in the internal clinical rotations at the University of Melbourne Veterinary Hospital and in the external clinical rotations and in the extramural placements. Students will be assessed in each of the five core themes of veterinary practice.\nEach of the rotation and extramural assessments will be weighted on the number of weeks (i.e. proportionate to the time undertaken in each rotation/placement). Rotation marks and feedback will be provided to the students within approximately 1 - 2 weeks of each rotation.\nHURDLE REQUIREMENTS 1-5:\nSatisfactory performance (defined by a mark of 60% or higher) in each of the five core themes individually, averaged across all internal and external clinical rotations, and extramural placements, is a hurdle requirement for this subject.\nInternal and External Clinical Rotations\nAll students must perform satisfactorily in each of the clinical rotations. Performance appraisal is undertaken by veterinary staff supervising the rotation and generally encompasses evaluation of attendance and punctuality, theoretical knowledge, practical skills, professional demeanour, oral and written communication skills, initiative and enthusiasm. Some rotations may require submission of a short written assignment or case report, an oral presentation, and /or successful completion of objective assessment tasks as part of the assessment.\nHURDLE REQUIREMENT 6:\nSatisfactory performance in each of the clinical rotations is a hurdle requirement for this subject. A student who fails to satisfactorily complete any rotation (i.e. a mark of 60% or higher) may be given the opportunity to repeat that rotation once.\nExtramural Placements\nStudents must perform to a satisfactory standard (as assessed by the designated Academic Associate or Supervising Veterinarian) during each of the extramural placements.\nHURDLE REQUIREMENT 7:\nAchieving a pass (i.e. a mark of 50% or higher) in each of the extramural elective placements is a hurdle requirement for this subject.\nA case log-book must be submitted in the required format if learning at an extramural elective placement is case-based (e.g. general and referral veterinary practices). A case log-book will comprise case record sheets of a minimum of 5 cases observed per week of placement and will illustrate the variety of cases investigated and treated over that period. Each log-book must be submitted in a neat format with the case record sheets bound or otherwise constrained within a presentation folder. All information presented in the log-book must be in English. The log-book or report must be submitted to the Faculty Academic and Clinical Programs Office. Each log-book or report will be reviewed by appropriate members of the Faculty.\nA placement block report must be submitted if an extramural elective placement does not involve case-based learning (e.g. placements with the Department of Primary Industries or equivalent).\nThe format of the report should be agreed upon in advance with the supervising veterinarian and the Head of Department, but is generally expected to describe the experience and achievements of the student during the placement. As a guide, the placement block report should be between four and five pages of double-spaced 12-point text.\nA Research Report must be submitted where an extramural elective placement is completed in a research facility. The form of this report will vary depending of the length of the research placement. The report should include a review of current research activities of the laboratory and a description of methodologies observed in the laboratory. Where students spend more than 3 weeks in the research facility, the report should in addition include an aim, description of results obtained and discussion of the results.\nHURDLE REQUIREMENT 8:\nStudents must submit a satisfactory case log-book, placement block report or a research report for each of the three electives."
