How can workplaces foster wellbeing in employees and assist their local communities to thrive?  What are the issues to consider? How do societies and nations measure wellbeing and develop policies to support collective wellbeing?</p>",
        "<p>Students will examine and appraise how wellbeing insights are being taught and applied in educational, organisational or community settings; analyse the role of wellbeing and virtues with respect to both subjective and objective outcomes; and assess implications of cross-cultural issues as well as trends in wellbeing policy. </p>"
