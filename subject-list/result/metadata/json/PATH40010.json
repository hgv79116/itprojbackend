    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject aims to introduce students to the field of research in clinical pathology and to facilitate the development of students\u2019 skills to critically evaluate and contribute to this exciting, contemporary field of research. Workshops will teach students to identify, interpret and analyse research articles. A collaborative mini-research experience will expose students to a range of research approaches, major advances and research gaps, and to potential translational application in one area of clinical pathology research. Designed to support students\u2019 Honours research journey, this subject provides opportunities for shared learning experiences and consumer engagement.</p>"
