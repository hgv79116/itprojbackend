        "<p>Principles of Structural Design introduces engineering and construction concepts with a mix of design projects, interactive workshops and lectures. An introduction to rigid body dynamics will be given through theory and case studies related to the built environment. Through analysis, model simulations, laboratory work, testing and evaluation, students will explore the fundamentals of structural analysis and commonly used construction methods and systems. The contextual links between structural theory and the finished construction will be provided by considering the fabrication, erection / construction and buildability issues.</p>"
