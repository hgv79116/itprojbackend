    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides the basis for the study of prosthodontics relating to the diagnosis, treatment planning, rehabilitation and maintenance of the oral function, comfort, appearance and health of patients with clinical conditions associated with missing or deficient teeth and/or oral and maxillofacial tissues using biocompatible substitutes.  This subject introduces prosthodontic clinical practice using an evidence-based approach through participation in seminar and case review meetings. Seminars will be prepared by students every 2-3 weeks and are presented by the students to the entire Prosthodontic cohort. Students will be introduced to several areas including: preclinical dentistry, treatment planning, biology and pathology of dental tissues, cast metal and porcelain restorations, endodontics, occlusion, fixed prosthodontics, Partial removable prosthodontics, complete removable prosthodontics, periodontology, orthodontics, maxillofacial prosthodontics, implant retained prosthes, craniomandibular disorders, radiography, dental geriatrics and laboratory skills.</p>",
        "<p>Students will commence clinical training activities in fixed, removable and implant prosthodontics under the close supervision of academics and specialists.  Sessions are scheduled at Royal Dental Hospital of Melbourne and Melbourne Dental Clinic. The student will be exposed to maxillofacial prosthetics and interdisciplinary links with other specialty programs for total patient care.</p>",
        "<p>Doctor of Dental Surgery Teaching Requirement<br/>Students participate in the teaching of general dentistry students for one session per week throughout the DDS teaching period.</p>"
