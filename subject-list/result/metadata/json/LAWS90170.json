    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject deals with the many ways in which \u2018the people\u2019 are or can be involved directly in decision-making on important public issues, rather than through elected representatives. Direct involvement of the people through the use of referendums has been a familiar feature of systems of government for some time. Recently, however, new mechanisms for the involvement of the people have begun to proliferate around the world, including in Australia, of which Citizens\u2019 Assemblies are only one example. In some jurisdictions, people demand more opportunities for participation and are critical of failures in representation. These developments are some of the most important challenges in public law  of the present time and raise several questions, including about representation and constitutionalism. The subject will examine the features of representative democracy that have encouraged this development to emerge; explore the complex relationship between representation and direct popular involvement; and analyse the range of issues that arise from the use of such techniques including, for example, selection, process and the management of outcomes. </p>",
        "<p>The instructors in this subject have extensive experience of forms of democracy in Australia and elsewhere and are enthusiastic about exploring the significance and meaning of this emerging new field.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics will include: </p>",
        "<ul><li>The scope of the field</li><li>Representative government and direct public participation</li><li>Referendums in all their forms</li><li>Emerging techniques for direct public participation</li><li>The issues, including terms of reference; selection, information, process, follow-up</li><li>Comparative context</li><li>Case studies</li></ul>",
        "<p>This subject is relevant for both Australian and international students with interests in public law and curiosity about the directions in which democratic institutions are heading. </p>"
