    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject investigates the legal regulation of workplace bargaining in Australia. With the requirement that bargaining be conducted in \u2018good faith\u2019 under the <em>Fair Work Act 2009</em> (Cth), this has become one of the most contested areas of federal labour regulation. The subject is informed by the historical, political and economic factors that have shaped the development of the law, as well as relevant international legal principles. While the focus of the subject is on the system regulating workplace bargaining under the <em>Fair Work Act</em>, other relevant areas of law are analysed, including the common law regulation of strikes and industrial action and the contract of employment. The role of competition law on the nature of collective bargaining for independent contractors is also examined.</p>",
