        "<p>Many applications require reliability in access to data, and data should not be lost even in the presence of hardware failures. The ability to retrieve and process the data very efficiently is also paramount even when multiple users access the data from remote sites simultaneously. With the increasing size of data used in these applications, advanced techniques for data management have emerged to make many such advanced requirements for access to data a reality. The subject covers the technologies used in advanced database systems that use these techniques. Topics covered will include: transactions, concurrency control, reliability, ACID properties, performance, indexing of both structured and unstructured data, query processing, and further topics on different database types and database architectures. </p>",
