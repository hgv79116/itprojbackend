        "<p>In this third learning area subject, Interns will extend and consolidate their understandings of the research and practice of teaching, with particular attention given to the critique of contemporary issues and debates in the disciplines in the Humanities and Social Sciences within Australia and beyond. The principles and practices of civics and citizenship education will be developed and applied throughout the semester, with a particular emphasis on the contribution that intercultural understanding can make to learning in the Humanities and an education for democratic citizenship more broadly.</p>",
        "<p>The assessment tasks in this subject will support Interns in strengthening their skills in identifying and adapting exemplary pedagogical practices to differentiate teaching and meet the specific needs of students of diverse backgrounds and abilities, including place-based learning, as well as critiquing and responding to key educational issues that impact on teaching and learning.</p>"
