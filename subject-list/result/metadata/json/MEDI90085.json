    "overview": [
        "<p>With the rapidly increasing volume of patients with a diagnosis of cancer there are an increasing number of patients having to deal with the consequences of cancer. This subject will provide an evidenced-based, best practice approach to both palliative care and survivorship care. It will address the physical, emotional and spiritual consequences of diagnosis, treatment and the supportive care services that address those. Students will also develop a detailed understanding of palliative care, its goals, techniques and limitations. In doing so, students will also explore the role of the multidisciplinary teams in various health care delivery models and how that influences patient centred care.</p>"
