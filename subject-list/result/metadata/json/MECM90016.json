    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject explores the complex relationship between digital media and politics, broadly defined to include a range of political processes, roles and responsibilities. Using timely political case studies, students will analyse the different mechanisms by which these two systems influence each. They will learn to read the different affordances of digital media and assess how the logical operation of these tools preferences certain types of politics over others. Students will develop a critical understanding of how digital media is changing political communication, preparing themselves for careers in politics, advocacy, campaigning and journalism. Topics will include: the political transparency of software; the relationship between politics, social media companies and the press; how to campaign and how to effect political change through digital communication.</p>"
