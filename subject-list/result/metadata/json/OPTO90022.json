    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject involves laboratory experimental research in an area of Vision Science. The project will be based in the laboratory of an academic staff member in the Department of Optometry &amp; Vision Sciences. Specific research projects will depend upon the availability of appropriate expertise, but may address a broad spectrum of vision science issues. The research project aims to develop a range of experimental and technical skills, a capacity to set goals and to design and plan experiments. The report describing the research will more closely resemble a scientific paper than a traditional thesis. Apart from the help and guidance from their supervisor(s) each student also has a committee which regularly meets with them and provides additional help and expertise. This committee is responsible for assessment of the research project subject.</p>"
