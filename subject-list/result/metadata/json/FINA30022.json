        "<p>Linking these investigations will be the theme of space in performance, which may be explored conceptually, metaphorically, structurally, or technologically \u2013 for example through an examination of the designed performance space and the found performance space, the use of scale in space, the potential for space to be ambiguous, the manipulation of space through the use of technology and the relationship of light and space.</p>",
        "<p>In all of these investigations, the student will be encouraged to think of space as a dramaturgical tool.</p>"
