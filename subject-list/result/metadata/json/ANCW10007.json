        "<p>In this subject, students consolidate the basic elements covered in Ancient Egyptian 1, and are introduced to more complex grammar and syntax, as well as some of the issues involved in interpreting an ancient language. Increasingly difficult texts are read from a variety of sources. Background information on ancient Egyptian culture is woven into the subject matter throughout the semester. By the end of the subject, students should have a sufficient grasp of the language and script to read hieroglyphic texts of moderate difficulty with vocabulary assistance. Students who successfully complete this subject may progress to Ancient Egyptian 3.</p>"
