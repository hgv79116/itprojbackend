        "<p>Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and related data driven processes - such as machine learning, neural networks, and foundational models - are affecting almost every aspect of modern society.  This subject investigates the challenges raised by this transformation for existing law and proposals for legislative regimes aimed specifically at AI. It will do this through a series of case studies critically examining different applications of  these key technologies and the responses by courts, regulators and legislatures to date.</p>",
        "<p>Through the lens of these case studies, students will:</p>",
        "<ul><li>critically consider the adequacy of traditional policy and law in responding to the challenges raised by AI;</li><li>explore what additional types of interventions and strategies might be used in responding to the distinctive characteristics of AI in society; and</li><li>investigate and evaluate the responses of different jurisdictions, including, as relevant, Australia, China, ASEAN, European Union, Canada and the United States in addressing the effective regulation of AI.</li></ul>"
