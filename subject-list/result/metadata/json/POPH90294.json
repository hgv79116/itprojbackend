    "overview": [
        "<p>Growing numbers of consumers are actively using a range of digital technologies for health-related purposes \u2013using connected mobile, wearable and social tech tools for taking care of their own health, sharing personal health data with others, accessing health services, and getting involved in health research.   Consumer health technologies may improve participation by patients and the public, making health systems more effective and efficient. Conversely, consumer health technologies may create conditions for inequity, misinformation and unethical uses of personal health data. <br/>Learners will develop knowledge about wise use of consumer health technologies through  four modules: dimensions of consumer digital health literacy; the global consumer health technology marketplace; lived experiences of active users of connected mobile and social health technologies; and scenarios where consumers are partners in designing and using digitally enabled learning health systems. <br/>Learners will be able to form critical views and understand how to take personal actions in connection with trends such as health self-quantification, direct-to-consumer online health services, patients as digital health co-designers, health infodemics, health citizen science and health hacktivism. Learning and teaching methods include live web-based tutorials, recorded webinars and lectures, online readings and case studies, and asynchronous discussions. Assessments are based on real-world challenges that health organisations face in using digital technologies for consumer-centred care and community engagement.   </p>"
