    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will examine changing definitions and conceptualisations of literacy in the 21st century. Candidates will explore literacy as a social practice, and the ways in which literacy is embedded in the construction of disciplines in institutions. Both in and out of school literacy practices will be investigated. Candidates will be introduced to key sociological and philosophical theorists in the fields of language and literacy and will critically engage with contemporary literacy and English curricula, and literacy and language policies.</p>"
