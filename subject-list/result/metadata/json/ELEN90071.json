        "<p>This subject has a twofold aim. First, it introduces students to auditory processing and auditory prostheses available for treating auditory impairment, and to visual processing and visual prostheses available for treating vision impairment. Topics covered in auditory processing and prostheses include: acoustics and auditory stimuli, auditory pathway, neural coding of sound, auditory psychophysics, hearing loss and auditory impairment, cochlear implants (the Bionic Ear) and cochlear implant stimulation strategies. Topics covered in visual processing and prostheses include: the retina, the visual pathway, vision psychophysics, visual prostheses, prosthetic vision and retinal implant stimulation strategies.</p>",
        "<p>Second, it introduces students to a number of important research skills: (i) how to prepare and present a lecture and (ii) how to provide feedback on the presentations of other students.<strong><br/><br/>INDICATIVE CONTENT<br/> </strong></p>",
