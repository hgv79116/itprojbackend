    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject continues the integrated and inter-disciplinary approach to the study of organ function and dysfunction in animals that was introduced in year one of the DVM course. Building on students\u2019 prior knowledge of body system function and dysfunction and their experience of scientific and clinical reasoning, this subject introduces students to the structure and normal functioning of the reproductive system, and to the principles of dysfunction of this system. Students will be introduced to the clinical disciplines of pharmacology and therapeutics, diagnostic imaging and clinical pathology as they relate to this system. Using case-based teaching approaches, they will apply their understanding of organ and system function and dysfunction to authentic situations that enhance the development of integrative clinical reasoning abilities, and the analysis of cases that involve multiple organ perturbation.</p>"
