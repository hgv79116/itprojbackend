    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject examines the art and politics of adaptation through a postcolonial lens. Moving beyond adaptation as merely the transformation of a story from one media to another, we will examine postcolonial rewritings of classic Western literary texts as well as adaptations of key postcolonial novels, drama and political writings into film, graphic novel, documentary form, and more. Throughout, we will consider how practices of postcolonial adaptation grapple with imperial knowledge forms, generate new meanings for new audiences, and raise critical questions around imitation, appropriation, cultural exchange, translation and genre.</p>"
