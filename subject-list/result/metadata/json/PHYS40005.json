        "<p>The student will conduct an original research project under supervision in the Department of Anatomy and Physiology or an affiliated institute from February to November. The student will be introduced to current literature and techniques in specialised areas. The student will acquire skills in experimental design, critical thinking, interpretation, and assessment of literature. The student will gain skills in communicating their research and complex research ideas in oral presentations and thesis writing. The research project will typically form part of a larger project or the basis of an expanded project. In either case, the work may culminate in a contribution to an original research publication.</p>",
