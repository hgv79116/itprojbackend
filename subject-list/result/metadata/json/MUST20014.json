        "<p>Students continue to expand their acting and singing skills in combination by autonomously preparing work for lecturer feedback through performances in various styles. Through acting, singing, and research students will further develop the combination of their skills toward performance. Skills in acting, dancing and singing in combination will progress through a performance in the ensemble of a main stage musical.</p>"
