    "overview": [
        "<p>Having recently passed the 30th anniversary of the landmark Australian medical law decision <em>Rogers v Whitaker </em>in 2022, medical litigation remains a vibrant and challenging field given the rapid pace of scientific and social developments that generate new challenges for the law. Many developments are at the core of individual importance - birth, reproduction and personal autonomy. The legal issues are wide-ranging, covering the existence of duties, what should be considered to be a breach of duty, the challenges of legal causation and the determination of appropriate compensation- all against a background of insurance affordability, medical treatment innovations and dispute resolution process changes.</p>",
        "<p>This subject examines the framework of medical litigation, current challenges and issues on the horizon. The subject coordinator Bill Madden is a lawyer specialising in medical litigation, a co-author of two health law texts and a regular writer and presenter on medical law topics.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>The history and incidence of medical litigation</li><li>The impact of recent legal and court-based reforms</li><li>Duty, breach of duty and statutory defences / protections</li><li>Consent, informed consent and treatment errors</li><li>Factual and normative causation and the loss of a chance</li><li>The changing framework of expert evidence</li><li>Privacy and confidentiality issues</li><li>Alternatives to fault based compensation</li><li>Associated regulatory issues</li><li>Coroners\u2019 investigations and hearings.</li></ul>"
