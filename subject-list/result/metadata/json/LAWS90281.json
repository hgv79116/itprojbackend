    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject explores the use and limits of comparative law and practice in public law litigation. The potential of comparative law in judicial-decision making has attracted increasing attention as information about legal developments in other jurisdictions has become more readily available. It raises particular challenges in public law, which this subject will consider.</p>",
        "<p>While the subject takes Australia as the home jurisdiction, the insights that it offers can be adapted to jurisdictions elsewhere. To encourage depth and contextual understanding, the subject is built around case studies drawn from three areas of law of contemporary significance: the movement of refugees, indigenous/state relations, and the environment. Each of these areas gives rise to litigation in Australia and can be expected to continue to do so. Each has also given rise to litigation elsewhere, which may have relevance in Australia despite differences in constitutional and legal frameworks.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics will include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Judicial engagement with comparative and international law</li><li>Australian constitutional and legal framework.</li><li>Case study 1: Movement of refugees</li><li>Case study 2: Indigenous relations with the state</li><li>Case study 3: Environment</li><li>Potential and limits of comparative law in public law litigation.</li></ul>"
