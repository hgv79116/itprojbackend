    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject explores the use of information and communication technologies from design to construction, to the post-delivery life cycle of buildings. The subject follows three overlapping themes: (i) historical overview of informatisation in the building industry, including the opportunities and constraints that follow these developments; (ii) discussion of contemporary issues in the delivery of building projects and potential solutions offered by ICT; and (iii) exposure to selected ICT methodologies and tools such as building information modeling and integrated project delivery solutions. The subject is organised as an advanced seminar supplemented with hands-on workshops in use of specific ICT solutions.</p>"
