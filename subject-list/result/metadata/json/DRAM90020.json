    "overview": [
        "<p><strong><em>Directing Methodologies</em></strong> addresses knowledge and techniques specific to the discipline of directing for performance. Through skills classes and seminars the subject explores the role of the director as part of a creative team, defining the skills, qualities and processes that are essential to the practising professional director. The subject involves a series of practical workshops and seminar sessions with guest industry speakers concerned with different aspects of the role of the director, particularly in relation to the performer and to dramatic text. Areas of skill development include poetic research, creative exploration from text, journaling, text selection and analysis and the early stages of preparation for rehearsal and production. Directing Methodologies in semester 1 leads directly onto Applied Directing in semester 2. It will include:</p>",
        "<p><strong><em>1. Introduction to Directing (9 hours)</em></strong></p>",
        "<p>A seminar-based introduction to Directing considering the role and position of the director in contemporary theatre practice and students\u2019 current thinking and creative aims for the coming year.</p>",
        "<p><strong><em>2. Nexus of Creative Practice and Research (50 hours)</em></strong></p>",
        "<p>Taking a text as a provocation, a series of workshops will explore practical creative approaches to researching and generating a vision for a project.

It involves traditional Asian and contemporary practices and kinaesthetic states and processes.</p>",
        "<p><strong><em>3. Seminars \u2013 Directing Methodologies and Reflective Practice (18 hours)</em></strong></p>",
        "<p>A series of practical seminars involving guest speakers and existing staff looking at major 20th Century directing methodologies. It will focus on the role of critical reflection, processes with performers, dramaturgical analysis and compositional ideas in contemporary practice.</p>"
