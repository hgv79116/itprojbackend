    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces students to the major ecological questions that can be addressed at the levels of individuals, populations, communities and ecosystems. What determines the distribution of individuals of a species? What controls the abundance of populations of a species? What determines the richness and diversity of species in a community? What governs the turnover of matter and energy in an ecosystem?</p>",
        "<p>Making use of aquatic and terrestrial examples, topics include organisms and the physical environment, life histories, population growth and regulation, managing populations, theoretical models, species interactions, community change and energy flows. The practical component will emphasise approaches to the collection and analysis of ecological data, and how to interpret and write scientific reports.</p>"
