        "<p>This subject comprises the Capstone experience for this course. Drawing on theory, knowledge and skills developed during the program, participants design and complete an individually negotiated, supervised investigative project.</p>",
        "<p>Projects tackle a real life policy or management issue; integrate student learning; and present an actionable proposal for policy makers or institutional managers.</p>",
        "<p>Participants are introduced to research and project management methods; given guidance in the design of their project; and must submit an 10,000 word report that may later form the basis of a workplace report or journal article.</p>",
        "<p>A hurdle requirement for this subject is that students will present their project design and findings to a panel and their peers on two occasions. The final presentation should include a reflection on the key learnings they have gained from their studies in the Master of Tertiary Education (Management).</p>"
