        "<p>This is an Honours reading seminar that examines key theoretical and methodological texts in political science.  The subject is designed to provide preparation for writing an Honours thesis while also enabling the consolidation, broadening and enhancement of students\u2019 knowledge of the discipline. Theoretical texts are critically examined in relation to political debates, case studies and empirical scholarship.Alongside its companion subject, Key Debates in Political Science 1, this subject will reflect the breadth of the discipline of political science, with a focus on identifying, distinguishing and relating key sub-disciplines and trans-disciplinary theoretical debates in politics and international studies.</p>",
        "<p>This second iteration of Key Debates in Political Science is divided into two parts. The first half is devoted to examining key concepts, theories, methods and problems in International Relations while the second half focuses on key theoretical, methodological and political debates in public policy, normative theory, and political science in general. Students completing the subject will have a robust understanding of what characterises the contemporary scholarly terrain of the discipline, and where their own research interests are located.</p>"
