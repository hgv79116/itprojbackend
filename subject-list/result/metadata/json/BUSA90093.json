    "overview": [
        "<p>This is an introductory course of valuation and financial management. The course is designed for <strong><em>all</em></strong> MBA students with career interests in managing any organizations where cash flows matter. It is based on the principle that firms should be managed to increase the wealth of their shareholders, subject to the fulfilment of their contractual and legal obligations to other stakeholders. To this purpose, this subject will focus on the valuation of financial assets and selection of investment projects. It provides a good foundation for those who want to specialize in finance and choose many finance electives we offer in later terms. Furthermore, students will find that the principles learned here can be readily applied to their own personal financial planning and investments.</p>"
