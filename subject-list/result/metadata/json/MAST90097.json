    "overview": [
        "<p>This course is an introduction to algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry is the study of zero sets of polynomials. It exploits the interplay between rings of functions and the underlying geometric objects on which they are defined. It is a fundamental tool in may areas of mathematics, including number theory, physics and differential geometry. The syllabus includes affine and projective varieties, coordinate ring of functions, the Nullstellensatz, Zariski topology, regular morphisms, dimension, smoothness and singularities, sheaves, schemes.</p>"
