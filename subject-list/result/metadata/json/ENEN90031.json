    "overview": [
        "<p><strong>AIMS</strong><br/><br/>Environmental problems are highly complex and challenging to analyse and are often addressed through modelling. Being skilled at environmental modelling is a core professional requirement for an Environmental Engineer. This subject focuses on environmental modelling methodology including the steps of model conceptualisation, model construction, model evaluation and model application using a range of energy, water and waste models. The subject complements ENEN90032 Environmental Analysis Tools and ENEN90028 Monitoring Environmental Impacts which provide other core environmental engineering skills. It provides modelling skills for a wide range of discipline based subjects such as ENEN90006 Solid Wastes, ENEN90034 Environmental Applied Hydrology and ENEN90027 Energy for Sustainable Development. The subject is of particular relevance to all Environmental Engineers but is also of relevance to a range of engineering and environmental analysis disciplines that require advanced modelling skills.</p>",
        "<p><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT</strong><br/><br/>The relationship between theoretical and empirical understanding and their use in model conceptualisation and construction will be explored. This subject introduces a range of environmental modelling techniques applicable to different environmental problems. In this subject students will conceptualise and construct, evaluate and utilise their own model to undertake a technical evaluation of a specified range of potential solutions to an environmental problem. Students will also develop professional judgement skills to critically evaluate models and model results.<br/><br/>Specific topic areas:</p>",
        "<ul><li>System conceptualisation</li><li>Model construction and validation (computational accuracy)</li><li>Model evaluation</li><li>Calibration and optimisation</li><li>Model uncertainty assessment techniques</li><li>Issues of appropriate model complexity</li><li>Students will have an opportunity to review a modelling topic of their choice.</li></ul>",
        "<p>Students will use a numerical programming language to undertake modelling tasks and will be required to learn some programming skills in the subject.</p>",
