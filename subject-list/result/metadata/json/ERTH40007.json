    "overview": [
        "<p>The School of Earth Sciences is home to a large and diverse range of research programs. Interests include the solid Earth, the fluid Earth (including our atmosphere and oceans) and processes that operate at the interface between these upon which all life on Planet Earth depends. Current research activities include: Climate Variability and Change, Atmosphere and Ocean Dynamics, Synoptic and Mesoscale Meteorology, Hydrogeology and Aqueous Biogeochemistry, Sedimentary Geology and Palaeontology, Palaeoclimate and Palaeoenvironmental Reconstruction, Thermochronology, Neotectonics and Landscape Evolution, Ore Deposit Geology, Geochemistry and Geochronology, Structural Geology, Tectonics and Geodynamics, Thermodynamics of Metamorphic Systems (THERMOCALC), Geochemistry and Geochronology of Magmatic Systems, Noble Gas Geochronology and Geochemistry, Computer Simulation of Geological and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics, Physics and Chemistry of the Earth's Deep Interior, and Energy: Resources and Futures.</p>",
        "<p>This subject comprises a major piece of original supervised research on a topic as agreed by the student and their supervisor. A literature review is conducted in the first six months of candidature and includes a research proposal describing the aims, significance and approach of the project.</p>",
        "<p>Students enrol in a total of 75 points of research project across the duration of the Honours program. This is achieved by enrolling in two of subjects across two consecutive semesters to achieve a total 75 credit points. Students enrol in a Part 1 subject in the first semester and a Part 2 subject in the second semester of the program.</p>",
        "<p>This subject (ERTH40007 Earth Sciences Research Project Pt 1) is a 25 point version for one semester.</p>"
