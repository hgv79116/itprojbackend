    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject supports early childhood preservice teachers to understand and use the early mathematical ideas and skills that are the foundation for becoming numerate. It focuses on early mathematical explorations and the ways in which, as educators, we can design and create learning ecologies to support young children to become numerate. Teacher Candidates will consider both the mathematics and the pedagogical content knowledge relevant to early childhood education (Birth to 8 years of age). This will assist them to develop a pedagogical repertoire that enables them to design learning ecologies that also reflect play-based approaches using the range of teaching practices encouraged in the Early Years Learning Framework (EYLF), the Victorian Early Years Learning and Development Framework (VEYLDF), and Australian/ Victorian Curricula. These teaching practices include; using an holistic approach that involves being responsive to young children\u2019s mathematical knowledge, skills and understandings,  learning early mathematical concepts through play in engaging learning ecologies, intentional teaching of mathematical concepts, continuity of mathematics and numeracy learning that is respectful of cultural diversity, and making mathematics and numeracy learning visible with formative and summative assessment implementation that is co-constructed with the young child, their families and the community.</p>"
