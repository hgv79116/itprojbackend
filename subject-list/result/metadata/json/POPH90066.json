        "<p>Developing and newly-industrialised countries experience wide variation in terms of history, politics, demographic transition, development and epidemiology. This subject situates women and their health in a dynamic context of development, globalisation and change. It examines key health issues, primarily for women in the Asian and Pacific Regions, but also in other international contexts, and explores factors that impact on health and illness throughout the lifespan. Gender, rights and \u2018empowerment\u2019 provide frameworks for analysis.</p>"
