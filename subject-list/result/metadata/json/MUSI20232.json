        "<p>This <em>online </em>subject offered by <em>The Wilin Centre </em>offers students insight into Indigenous musical instruments in Australia.</p>",
        "<p>Case studies introduce the cultural and spiritual significance of particular instruments, trace their creation (from sourcing of materials, to design, to methods of crafting), and demonstrate their uses in music and dance.</p>",
        "<p>Webinars, guided viewing and listening, practice, reading, and discussion, will complement the case studies and deepen student\u2019s appreciation of the knowledges, technologies, techniques, and aesthetics, of Indigenous musical instruments.  </p>",
        "<p>Students will use knowledge from webinars, viewing and listening, reading, and discussion, to prepare a listening journal and either an essay or creative portfolio. Students will also develop and submit a critical reflection on their learning experience. </p>",
        "<p>This subject provides students with the opportunity to develop awareness of Indigenous musical instruments in Australia, and to develop language and skills to approach, talk, and write, about this knowledge in a respectful and culturally appropriate manner.</p>",
