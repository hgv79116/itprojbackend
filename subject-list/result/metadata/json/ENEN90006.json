    "overview": [
        "<p><strong>AIMS</strong><br/><br/>In this subject students will learn about the fundamentals of the solid waste stream in modern society. Emphasis will be placed on the life cycle aspects of waste and the prospect of minimizing waste and maximizing the economic value of waste streams. Interaction between solid wastes and liquid and gaseous waste streams will also be considered. The subject builds on knowledge from subjects such as CVEN90043 Sustainable Infrastructure Engineering where general principles of sustainability are discussed. Student knowledge of systems and material cycles, learnt in subjects such as ENEN90031 Quantitative Environmental Modelling and CVEN30010 Systems Modelling and Design or their equivalent in other subjects forms the basic grounding for the subject. The subject is of particular relevance to students wishing to establish a career in waste management, but is also relevant to a range of engineering design disciplines where design for the total life cycle of the product or infrastructure should be considered.<br/><br/><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT</strong><br/><br/>Regulatory aspects of waste management, sustainability programs in government and private sector, life cycle assessment, organic waste treatment and management, inorganic waste treatment and management, landfill hydrology and design, cleaner production strategies, hazardous waste management, collection and transport logistics.</p>"
