    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will provide physiotherapy students with a general conceptual and evidence-based background in foundational biomedical sciences that underpin physiotherapy clinical practice and research. It will build on and integrate assumed areas of knowledge in the disciplines of anatomy and physiology and introduce students to the underlying principles of biochemistry, pharmacology and pathology in the areas of cardio-respiratory, musculoskeletal and neurological sciences. Students will be expected to apply this knowledge in appropriate cases as a basis for developing clinical reasoning and decision-making skills in physiotherapy practice. The subject will be completed with an integration of body systems around complex problems.</p>"
