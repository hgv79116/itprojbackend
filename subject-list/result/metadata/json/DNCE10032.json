        "<p>This subject addresses contemporary political perspectives on the body and the role of the dancer as public artist. It provides a foundation for key theoretical and socio-political approaches to dance including feminist, ecological, queer and decolonising.</p>",
        "<p>Through seminar presentations, students are introduced to key theoretical and philosophical texts that have informed dance knowledge in the 21st century. Reading groups work to discursively and dialogically engage with these ideas and discuss what ideas and concepts mean in terms of practice.</p>",
        "<p>Thinking through practice is developed through studio sessions that take theory into the studio where it can be taken hold of, tested and mobilised. Students will gain skills in research that integrates theory and practice and learn how to present their learning through lecture performance.</p>"
