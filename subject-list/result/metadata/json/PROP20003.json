    "overview": [
        "<p>Modern-day, sophisticated property professionals, in their roles as key advisers, developers or investors, are required to lead and/or act in close collaboration with a wide range of other professionals in the analysis and management of property development and property investment projects. Professional property practitioners need to gain a strong understanding of the principles, processes and systems associated with the design and construction of buildings. Construction is, effectively, the largest cost element in a property\u2019s lifecycle, is a source of considerable risk, and its project management is of major importance.<br/><br/>This subject provides an introduction to that strategic knowledge. It discusses, for instance, residential low rise construction e.g. individual house-dwellings, master planned communities, and, commercial and industrial construction systems e.g. medium and high density residential, offices, warehouses, shopping centres, by providing a broad overview on the materials utilised, construction methods, the management of the construction process and the roles of the other professional that, as a team, deliver project.<br/><br/>The various design concepts and structural systems currently used are discussed with an emphasis on how those building features affect the use and cost of construction and, thereby, the value of a property. The selection of materials, its application and performance are incorporated throughout the subject, leading to an awareness of building performance and maintenance, which also impact on property performance, profitability and value.<br/><br/>The subject describes and emphasises the indelible links between the market\u2019s demand for property, financial feasibility of projects, the design response, the methods, systems and cost of construction and their combined effect on property values.<br/><br/>This subject, will the delivered in a series of weekly lectures, tutorials and a number of visits to construction sites.</p>"
