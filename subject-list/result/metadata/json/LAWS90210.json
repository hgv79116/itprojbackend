    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will provide an interdisciplinary framework to discuss various aspects of the intersection between law, human behaviour and justice. The first part will be dedicated to developing a basic familiarity with the relevant principles of psychology and law and discuss the ways in which they interrelate. In the second part of the subject we will discuss different real life examples, involving judicial decision making, witness reliability, negotiations and more, in which the study of psychological concepts in the legal world plays out.</p>"
