    "overview": [
        "<p><em>Meaning</em> is central to many issues in philosophy. The idea that the meaning of complex representation depends on the meanings of its parts is fundamental to the way we understand the mind, language, and logic. In this subject, we look at the different ways that this idea has been understood and applied throughout the 20th Century and into the present day.</p>",
        "<p>In the first part of the subject, our focus is on the concepts of necessity and possibility, and the way that \u2018possible worlds semantics\u2019 has been used in theories of meaning. We will focus on the logic of necessity and possibility (modal logic), times (temporal logic), conditionality and dependence (counterfactuals), and the notions of analyticity and <em>a priority,</em> which are central to much philosophy.</p>",
        "<p>In the second part of the subject, we will examine closely the assumption that every statement we make is either true or false but not both. We will examine the paradoxes of truth (like the so-called \u2018liar paradox\u2019) and vagueness (the \u2018sorites paradox\u2019), and we will investigate different ways attempts at resolving these paradoxes by going beyond our traditional views of truth (using \u2018many valued logics\u2019) or by defending the traditional perspective.</p>",
        "<p>The subject serves as an introduction to ways that logic is applied in the study of language, epistemology and metaphysics, so it is useful to those who already know some philosophy and would like to see how logic relates to those issues. It is also useful to those who already know some logic and would like to learn new logical techniques and see how these techniques can be applied.</p>"
