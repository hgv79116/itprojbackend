    "overview": [
        "<p><strong>AIMS</strong><br/><br/>This subject explores the scope and methods for improving energy efficiency across a range of sectors. Improving energy efficiency is one of the key responses to increasingly scarce natural resources and problems caused by pollutants arising from energy production and use. A range of energy supply and usage scenarios will be considered including transport, manufacturing, commercial and domestic sectors. Collection of information by auditing and then using this information for planning, demand management and impact assessment will be investigated.<br/><br/>Knowledge gained in this subject will allow graduates to practice in the area of energy efficiency. This subject draws on students\u2019 fundamental understanding of engineering efficiency, as well as their ability to use mathematics and statistics to analyse data to inform innovative solutions. The subject complements other subjects offered in the energy theme of the Department such as Energy for Sustainable Development and Sustainable Infrastructure Engineering.<br/><br/><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT</strong><br/><br/>Areas of study include: potential for improvements in energy efficiency in petrol and diesel vehicles; energy efficiency technologies for the manufacturing, commercial and domestic sectors; demand side management; integrated resource planning; energy auditing; and economic and environmental impacts.</p>",
