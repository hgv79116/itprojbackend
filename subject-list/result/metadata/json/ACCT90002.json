        "<p>Financial Statement Analysis seeks to introduce students to the analysis and use of financial information for decision-making purposes. The subject considers how the information disclosed can be best utilised by creditors and investors in making their lending and investing decisions. Students consider the environment in which financial reporting exists, including the incentives faced by preparers of financial reports. From their assessment, students learn to adjust reported data as is typically done by analysts.</p>",
