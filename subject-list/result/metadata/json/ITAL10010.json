        "<p>This subject continues its focus on the spoken and written language and culture of present day Italy. Students will undertake regular activities in order to further develop their linguistic and cultural skills. They will also participate in regular conversation practice for the purpose of reinforcing their command of current idiomatic Italian to a higher standard. Students will expand their knowledge of contemporary Italian culture and language, through a critical analysis of a variety of texts and documents (including films, music, mass media and literature). By the end of the subject, students should have further improved their written production skills and should be able to express themselves with fluency on most topics.</p>"
