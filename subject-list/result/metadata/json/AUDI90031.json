        "<p>In this unit, speech production development and speech production disorders from infancy through childhood to adolescence and adulthood will be presented. In relation to disorder, Developmental, Syndromic/Genetic, Neurodegenerative/Movement and Acquired speech production disorders will be the focus of study. Traditional and current approaches to the investigation of speech disorders across the lifespan will be included. The unit will focus on the description, assessment, differential diagnosis and treatment of speech disorders. The course will also cover the impact of speech disorders on impairment, activity and participation (using the WHO International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health framework) within the context of school achievement and peer, family, and work relationships.</p>"
