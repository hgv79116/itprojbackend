    "overview": [
        "<p>The subject explores a contemporary accounting issue arising from a socio-economic event through an international study program. Students are first briefed on financial and management accounting research on the issue chosen for the program. The students then visit a number of major corporate, regulatory and standard-setting institutions in either the U.S.A (July program) or Europe (January program) depending on the semester.<br/><br/>There, top-level executives present their organisations\u2019 perspective on the issue and other current issues affecting the organisation. Students engage with them to explore how their pre-departure prepared research-based project is reflected in practice as observed during the respective site visits.<br/><br/>On their return, students undertake a reflective analysis of research and their experiences. A key requirement is that students comport themselves professionally throughout the course.<br/><br/>Note: Travel and accommodation costs will be borne by the student. Students must be eligible to obtain visitor visas in the country where the subject is conducted.</p>"
