    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces students to the specialised field of international environmental law. International environmental law is the field of public international law concerned with the protection of the natural environment, and those aspects of the built environment recognised as world cultural heritage. It is a vitally important branch of international law, seeking as it does to safeguard the environment upon which humanity depends for its very existence. International environmental law seeks to integrate the activities of diverse actors - States, international organisations, businesses, communities and non-government organisations (NGOs) - and uses a wide range of legal tools (including economic instruments and participatory mechanisms) to address pressing environmental concerns. <br/><br/>This subject explores the critical governance and regulatory dimensions of international environmental law, as well as introducing you to cases and treaties that have been pivotal to the development of this area of international law. Case studies considered throughout the subject will provide students with an understanding of recent developments in the disciplinary area.</p>"
