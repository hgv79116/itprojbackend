        "<p>This is the first of a sequence of two subjects (Foundation Mathematics 1 and Foundation Mathematics 2) providing BSc(Ext) students with a foundation in mathematics that prepares students for the Bachelor of Science and a pathway into the Bachelor of Commerce. The content consists of traditional VCE mathematical topics, with a particular emphasis on those topics needed for subsequent studies in the Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Commerce degrees. Applications, examples and problems will be taken from these disciplines.</p>"
