    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will help students to become better and more skilled readers and writers of research in the fields of business and commerce. Students will build competencies in academic literacy that will be directed toward reading, writing, and publishing in both corporate and academic contexts. The principal factors that editors, publishers, and employers consider when evaluating journal submissions and professional reports will be discussed. Guidelines will also be provided on how to respond to constructive criticism from senior professionals in the corporate context and from editors or peer-reviewers in the academic context. These considerations and others will be explored through lectures, tutorials, workshops, and a series of 'Master Classes' conducted by senior academics, editors, professionals and editors.</p>"
