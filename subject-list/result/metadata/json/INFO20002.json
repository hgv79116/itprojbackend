        "<p><strong>Aims</strong></p>",
        "<p>The ability to access, manipulate, organise, analyse and display data are fundamental skills for scientists, historians, managers, financiers, artists and many other professions. This subject explores various computational methods to represent, transform, and make sense of large, diverse sets of data such as share market prices, scientific data or demographic data. This subject is core within the Bachelor of Science for the Major of Informatics. Students completing the Diploma of Informatics can also take this subject.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Indicative Content</strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject serves as an introduction to Informatics. Its main focus is on representing and manipulating data using spreadsheet tools; basic web page construction using HTML and style-sheets; representing and manipulating information on the web using a scripting language. These skills form a useful basis for those looking at careers in which the manipulation and visualisation of information takes place.</p>"
