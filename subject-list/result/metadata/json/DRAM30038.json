        "<p>This subject extends insights into independent production and promotion in readiness for graduates to enter the theatre industry as emerging artists. Through seminars and panel discussions with industry professionals, students will further their knowledge of professional pathways and best practice protocols and processes that will support them as independent artists. Project pitching and budgeting, marketing and media, self and company promotion, taxation and business skills for independent artists are examined.</p>",
        "<p>Students will develop an e-portfolio applying their knowledge of professional practice, independent production and self- and company- promotion to tasks pertaining to their works and projects in development. In preparing appropriate resources, students will have the opportunity to demonstrate their ability to apply production and promotion skills, and project knowledge while sustaining a professional working ethos.</p>"
