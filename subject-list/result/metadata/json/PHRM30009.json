    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject represents a definitive Capstone subject for students completing a major in pharmacology and is equally relevant for all students interested in biomedical research. Students will learn how to design and perform experiments to investigate biological systems. Students will also gain experience in a wide range of molecular and cellular approaches and in analytical techniques used in drug discovery. Students will be provided with the opportunity to apply their experience and discipline-specific knowledge in challenging and authentic, real-world scenarios, before completing a short University-led research project. The assessment will develop and reinforce essential research skills. In their research project, students will work within a small team under the supervision of a University academic to design and conduct a study to investigate their unique research question and learn how to effectively communicate their research and disseminate their findings.</p>"
