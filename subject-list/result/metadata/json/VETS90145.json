        "<p>This subject focuses on both the general principles of veterinary clinical practice and the specific approach to diagnosis, management and prevention of disease in poultry in production systems and aviary birds. Content will be delivered in blocks based on clinical presentation in parallel with related presentations in other species, an approach that is designed to support students in the development of their diagnostic reasoning skills, and encourage a comparative view of veterinary medicine and surgery.</p>"
