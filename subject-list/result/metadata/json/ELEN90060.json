        "<p><strong>AIMS</strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject provides an insight into the fundamental elements to analyse electrical power transmission and distribution systems, with both analytical and simulation tools for analysis of operations of these systems. Problems related to power flow and use of Newton-Raphson and other algorithms such as backward-forward sweep will be discussed. Fault calculation and analysis, symmetrical components, and analytical methods for solving symmetrical (balanced) faults will be covered. Principles, concepts and problems related to power system dynamics and control, particularly for frequency and voltage regulation, will be discussed and analysed in detail. Finally, small-signal, transient, voltage and frequency stability will be introduced and exemplified. Focus will be put on real-world examples, particularly to prepare the student for the ongoing transition towards a low-carbon grid dominated by renewables and distributed energy resources.</p>",
