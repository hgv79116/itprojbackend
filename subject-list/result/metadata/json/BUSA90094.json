        "<p> </p>",
        "<p>Lectures and cases will introduce discounting and interest rate mathematics, principles of valuation, the weighted average cost of capital, and capital structure of firms. Along the way we will develop knowledge and intuition about the purpose of the different components of the financial systems (financial markets, financial intermediaries and financial instruments) and how those components create value</p>"
