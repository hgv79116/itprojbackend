    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject builds on students\u2019 prior knowledge, exploring the diversity and unity of life through the lens of five core concepts: evolution, cell theory, regulation, transmission of information and interconnectedness in biological systems. These concepts will be studied at the molecular, cellular, and individual level. Topics will include the evolution of life from the abiotic to the individual, the molecular and physical structure of the cell, cell replication and gene expression, homeostasis and physiological systems regulation, respiration, and interactions within and between organisms.</p>"
