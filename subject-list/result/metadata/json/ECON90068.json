    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will emphasise the application of economic theory and empirical methods to the analysis and development of public policy. The subject will consist of modules, with each module to cover a specific policy application. A module will consist of an introduction to a policy issue, an overview of relevant theory and empirical tools, demonstrate application of those tools to address the policy issue, and options for presenting the findings. The orientation this subject will be to applications of microeconomic theory and methods. This might involve, for example, design of environmental policy using auction theory; evaluating whether there is evidence of collusive behaviour by firms in an industry using game theory and econometric methods; design of welfare and tax policies using micro-simulation modelling and other methods; and using benefit-cost analysis to evaluate the net gain to society from active labour market programs. The exact applications taught will vary over time depending on the staff teaching the subject.</p>"
