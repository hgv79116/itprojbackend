    "overview": [
        "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Microscopy is the key technique for imaging fine structure in biological specimens. This subject will introduce the range of methods and capabilities of light microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and laser scanning confocal microscopy, as well as the methods of specimen preparation for standard histochemical and immunocytochemical techniques. The principles and scientific basis underpinning the various methods and techniques will be explained, and applications to current cutting-edge science and technology will be discussed. Practical and project work will include demonstration of equipment and analysis of images and data.</p>"
