    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject consists of a two-week field trip to China in July with some pre-departure (in semester 1) and post-field trip workshop/seminars (in semester 2) in Melbourne. The subject is designed to develop students\u2019 interests in Asia, in China in particular, and in the interactions between society, economy, government, and the environment. While in China, students will interact with local communities, academics and environmental managers who will inform them about issues and processes in China. This will be supplemented by site visits and household interviews. The field trip will be under the supervision of the subject coordinators. Students are responsible for the cost of airfares, accommodation and food.</p>",
        "<p><em>Note this subject may be taken as the Capstone subject in the Geography major of the BA and BSc. All students, whether they are capstone students or not, will be required to complete online introductory materials that are common across all field classes, and will be invited to a discussion session together at the end of their Capstone study and experience.</em></p>",
