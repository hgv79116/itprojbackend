    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject takes a critical approach to research ethics, offering students the opportunity to engage in debates concerning power and marginalisation within the context of their academic research projects. Using an interdisciplinary framework, concepts such as relationality, positionality and an ethics of care will be examined, opening up challenging areas of research practice. The subject will provide an understanding of the principles of research ethics (both human and animal research ethics), the origins of ethical standards, the cultural specificity of these standards, and of contested areas of research ethics. It will highlight the relationship between academic research ethics and standards adopted in industry through professional codes of practice or standards. The subject is intended to be of use both in terms of framing one\u2019s own academic research project and in developing a level of ethical know-how that can inform research practices within academia, industry and community settings.</p>"
