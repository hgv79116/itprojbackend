        "<p><strong>AIMS</strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject is available as an elective in many of the Faculty of Engineering and IT Masters programs. It is aimed both at students who have immediate entrepreneurial intentions and at students who may be considering starting their own business at some point in their careers. The subject is designed to introduce all participants to their potential as entrepreneurs. By developing their own enterprise proposal within small groups, students will learn and demonstrate various processes by which successful new ventures move from idea to launch.</p>",
        "<p><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT</strong></p>",
        "<p>Business modelling, opportunity analysis, value creation, financial management, sources of finance, creativity, innovation, entrepreneurial behaviour, successful engineering entrepreneurs.</p>",
        "<p><strong>TEACHING METHOD</strong></p>",
        "<p>The teaching method is based around a structured process of mini-lectures, class exercises, and active hands-on learning by doing. Intensive field research and minimum viable product development are very important to the subject. Learning is further enhanced through meetings with the lecturer and review by peers.</p>"
