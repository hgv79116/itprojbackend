        "<p>Students will learn how to structure and work with engineering contracts to deliver and procure engineering outcomes in this subject. Students will develop a working knowledge of contract administration and gain an understanding of commercial aspects of engineering. All engineers interface commercially with engineering contracts throughout their careers, and thus the application of the subject content is broad. Those seeking to work as a contractor and as a contract administrator will find a direct application of this subject\u2019s content. Students will learn how to use procurement and contracts to develop successful engineering projects. This includes administration of the contracts and understanding the business environment where these contracts are agreed. These skills will be useful to students in their future work and apply to a wide range of engineering disciplines.</p>",
        "<p><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT</strong></p>",
        "<p>Management of engineering projects. This includes the role and responsibilities of corporate managers, market analysis, structuring of procurement options, development of contractual terms and conditions and the pricing of work.</p>",
        "<p>Estimating and tendering engineering works via work breakdown structures, work method statements, risk identification and tendering principles. The study material also covers contract administration and project control functions and techniques including time and money negotiations and cash flow management.</p>"
