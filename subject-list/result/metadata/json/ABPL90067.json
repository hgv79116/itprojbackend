        "<p>ABPL90067 MSD Thesis - Semester Long (25 points) is designed to produce a 10,000 word critical exposition of knowledge, gained through the student's own efforts to demonstrate a sound understanding of a topic of their choice. Regular meetings will be held with a supervisor to allow students to obtain advice on the study topic and help guide their independent study. Material prepared in any of the following subjects is expected to form an integral part of the final research report:<br/><br/>ABPL40041 Research Methods (Honours)<br/>ABPL90070 Research Methods (Masters)<br/>ABPL90135 Analytical Methods</p>",
