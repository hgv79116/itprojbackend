    "overview": [
        "<p>Environmental law deals with pressing legal and social issues within Australia and internationally that range from biodiversity protection to waste reduction. This subject provides an overview of fundamental environmental law concepts and principles, such as the precautionary principle. It charts the evolution of Australian environmental law in response to global environmental challenges, such as climate change, as well as national regulatory reforms. The subject equips students with a thorough grounding in environmental impact assessment law by reference to the <em>Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 </em>(Cth). It examines the regulatory tools and approaches relevant to pollution control and ecological protection\u2013 including market mechanisms and offset models. This subject introduces international environmental law; dealing with issues such as trans-boundary harm and World Heritage protection, that have shaped Australian environmental law.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>The scope of environmental law \u2013 nationally and internationally \u2013 including transboundary regulation.</li><li>The multidisciplinary character of environmental law and regulation that needs to respond to complex, multilevel environmental problems.</li><li>The diversity of environmental law approaches from the common law through direct regulation to market measures and community engagement.</li></ul>",
        "<p>These themes are illustrated by case studies in the following areas:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Environmental law: Principles and concepts</li><li>Environmental actors, including public interest litigation with a focus on biodiversity protection</li><li>The procedures and substantive law governing impact assessment and development approvals.</li><li>Legal and regulatory tools used in environmental law, including duty of care concepts in pollution laws.</li><li>The interaction of law and science, with a focus on the precautionary principle</li><li>Implementation, compliance and enforcement in Environmental Law</li><li>International environmental law, including biodiversity protection, world heritage cases and climate change governance.</li></ul>"
