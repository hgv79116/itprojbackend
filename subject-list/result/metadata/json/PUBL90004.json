        "<p>This subject studies the elements of successful communication in business and professional contexts, and how these elements also translate into one's personal communication. We study key skills, both written and oral, and take a resolutely practical approach to communication in all forms, including presentations, report writing, Plain English strategies, cross-cultural communications, writing collaboratively and crisis management.<br/>We examine the role of communication within the organisation and develop practical tools for effective communication and negotiation. We use practical examples to develop our ability to build rapport, our presentation skills and our body language.</p>"
