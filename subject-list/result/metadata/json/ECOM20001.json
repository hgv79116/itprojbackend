    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides an introduction to econometrics, which involves using data and statistical methods to estimate economic relationships, test economic theory, and predict the impact of policy. Topics covered include probability and statistics, single linear regression, multiple linear regression, non-linear regression, model internal and external validity, field and natural experiments, and time series models. Econometric methodology and application will be motivated and illustrated through applications to economics, accounting, finance, marketing, and management.</p>"
