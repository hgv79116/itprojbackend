        "<p>In the preparation and conduct of litigation no area of law is more important than the law of evidence. <em>Advanced Evidence</em> aims to provide students with an enhanced understanding of the law of evidence. This subject focuses on key provisions of the uniform evidence legislation, which now operates in all Commonwealth, Victorian, New South Wales, Tasmanian, Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory courts, and primarily examines the law of evidence in the context of criminal proceedings, where it is is strictly applied. Students can expect to refresh, deepen and develop their understanding of the factual, legal and policy issues associated with the law of evidence and to learn to analyse the admissibility of evidence at an advanced level</p>",
        "<p>This subject is primarily based on a detailed examination of those rules of evidence regarding admissibility that are of particular significance in trials, especially criminal trials.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics may include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Relevance</li><li>Hearsay evidence</li><li>Opinion evidence</li><li>Admissions</li><li>Tendency and coincidence evidence</li><li>Credibility evidence</li><li>Identification evidence</li><li>Discretionary and mandatory exclusion of evidence.</li></ul>",
        "<p>Note: this is a highly technical subject taught at an advanced level. It is only recommended for students with a law background.</p>",
