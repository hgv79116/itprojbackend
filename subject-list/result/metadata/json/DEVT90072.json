    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject aims to provide a critical overview of \u2018Development\u2019 in Latin America. It seeks to engage critical perspectives concerning uneven development, processes of inequality and marginalisation, and patterns of globalisation in Latin America. By grounding theoretical arguments in contemporary empirical contexts (i.e., countries in Latin America), the subject attempts to make sense of current development issues in Latin America. Topics to be explored include the following: histories of development and postcolonial critiques; theories of development from Latin American scholars; urbanisation, poverty, and informality; gender and development; post-development critiques in Latin America; collective mobilisation and social movements; political ecology and environmental vulnerabilities; identity, race, and indigeneity; contemporary governance and state power in development initiatives.</p>"
