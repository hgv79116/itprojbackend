        "<p>Concepts in Applied Linguistics is a compulsory subject for all students on the Master in Applied Linguistics, and should be taken in the first semester of enrolment in the program. This introductory subject teaches students core concepts; current issues and debates; and diverse research methods in applied linguistics. It introduces students to the three principal specialisations of the Master program: Teaching English as a Second Language (TESOL); Language Testing; and English Language. It tracks the origins of these fields from their diverse theoretical inceptions, such as psycholinguistics, pedagogy and sociolinguistics, to their applications in various domains, including, for example, language teaching and learning; language assessment; and language policy and planning. It also shows how advancements in applied linguistics have been applied to real-world problems such as how to train language teachers; how to design fair and effective language tests; how to combat language discrimination; and how minority languages can be revived and maintained. The subject is an essential part of foundational study for the Master and prepares students for more specialised subjects on the program; for further independent research and study; and for professions in public service, teaching, translation and speech pathology.</p>"
