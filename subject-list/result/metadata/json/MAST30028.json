    "overview": [
        "<p>Most mathematical problems arising from the physical sciences, engineering, life sciences and finance are sufficiently complicated to require computational methods for their solution. This subject introduces students to the process of numerical approximation and computer simulation, applied to simple and commonly encountered stochastic or deterministic models. An emphasis is on the development and implementation of algorithms for the solution of continuous problems including aspects of their efficiency, accuracy and stability. Topics covered will include simple stochastic simulation, direct methods for linear systems, data fitting of linear and nonlinear models, and time-stepping methods for initial value problems.</p>"
