    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject equips students with the skills and knowledge to understand the mind-body and movement through the nexus of art and science. Emphasis is placed equally on scientific knowledge (dance science) and embodied practice (somatic modes of learning) which are both essential for the training of elite professional dancers. By weaving together these two complementary threads (dance science with somatic practice), students develop a broad foundation on which to develop further advanced dance training.</p>",
        "<p>The dance science thread blends theory and practice to investigate the body and mind through physiology, anatomy, biomechanics, motor learning, psychology and safe dance practice (including warm-up/cool down, rest and recovery, supplementary fitness training, and nutrition).</p>",
        "<p>The somatic practice thread draws on Eastern and Western approaches to embodied knowledge, to provide experiential insight into the skeletal, muscular, visceral, vestibular and neurological systems of the human body in order to enhance effective performance and personal expressiveness.</p>",
        "<p>Together the somatic and scientific threads combine to generate an in-depth knowing of the mind-body and clarify each student\u2019s understanding of their unique physical and psychological self and patterns of moving. Through this subject, students will develop the knowledge to optimise their physical and mental performance, avoid injury and work safely as dancers within diverse situations.</p>"
