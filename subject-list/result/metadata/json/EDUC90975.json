    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject examines the foundations of human learning through a neurological lens, ranging from the sensory detection, encoding, storage, retrieval, storage, and behavioural outputs, to social constructs of learned information. A neuroscience of learning lens will also be used as a framework for critiquing educational practices, policies and products. The subject will provide opportunities for students to analyse ways in which findings derived from neurological research can be used to inform their professional practice.</p>"
