        "<p>Students in the Filmmaking specialisation will develop a screen project collaboratively or individually with the intent to take it to an audience or market. Projects will be self or team driven, through a combination of independent study and workshops. Implementing both creative and commercial skills developed throughout the course, students will develop a project suitable for pitching to the commercial or indie market, including financiers or alternative funding solutions.</p>",
        "<p>The project will be developed to both enhance and showcase the student's creative voice and the craft skills they have developed throughout the course, opening clear pathways between higher education and the creative industries. This process will include research for both the project, and its potential platforms and audiences, as well as story and pitch materials of a professional standard.</p>",
        "<p>Working with other creative contributors or elements, students will define their role within the project and develop a unified creative vision for a practical project that can be realised within a given budget, time and framework.</p>"
