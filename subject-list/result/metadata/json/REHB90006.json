    "overview": [
        "<p>This online subject provides students with the opportunity to build a deep understanding of the safe and effective application of rehabilitation principles to meet the health needs of women. Attention is focused on conditions affecting women specifically from young adulthood through to their reproductive and older years.  Students will develop an extended knowledge of pathophysiology and clinical presentations that typically affect women\u2019s experience of women\u2019s health. Students will use an evidence-informed framework for their analysis and synthesis of recent literature and contextual factors that influence clinical practice across the lifespan.</p>",
        "<p>All students will complete foundational work that will explore the typical physiological changes occurring in women from young adulthood through to the reproductive and older years.</p>",
        "<p>Students will then choose 2 from 3 streams that best meets their learning interests and/or practice needs. These streams are:</p>",
        "<p>1. Young women stream focuses on a deeper exploration of the physical, psychological and cultural expressions of adolescent development and the rehabilitation of clinical conditions associated with adolescence e.g. dysmenorrhea, female athlete triad.</p>",
        "<p>2. Fertile women stream comprises of an exploration of fertility and infertility. There will be a focus on physical and psychological changes occurring during the childbearing year and post-natal recovery and appropriate rehabilitation. </p>",
        "<p>3. Older women stream will focus on the physiology and psychology of the maturing woman including the effects of physical activity on the ageing musculoskeletal system, and the management of conditions associated with advancing age e.g. incontinence, bone health.</p>",
        "<p>All students will then focus on the application of rehabilitation theory to practice. Students will critically review literature and with an understanding of the needs of the individual and her engagement within a group program will solve contextually relevant rehabilitation challenges for women.</p>"
