Some cafes, restaurants, and retail outlets are also companies. Your social media accounts are all connected to a company.</p>",
        "<p>What\u2019s most fascinating is that, just like you and I, companies are people. They are recognised in the eyes of the law as \u2018artificial\u2019 legal persons. They enjoy some of the same rights as us \u2018natural\u2019 people.</p>",

        "<ul><li>the incorporation process and its consequences;</li><li>the regulation on company shareholders and directors and their effects on those who deal with companies;</li><li>the internal composition of companies i.e., who are the people behind the corporate entity (such as shareholders, directors, secretaries);</li><li>how companies can enter into contracts with outsiders and what the outsiders can assume when dealing with company participants;</li><li>the duties and liabilities of company directors and other offers and what consequences they face under law if they do the wrong thing;</li><li>The actions and remedies you can take against a company if you have been wronged or harmed by the company or its participants.</li></ul>"
