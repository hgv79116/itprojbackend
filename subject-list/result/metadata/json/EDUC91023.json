    "overview": [
        "<p>Learning in Australian early childhood environments requires understanding children\u2019s identities in order to create and foster deep relations of belonging and connection. Exploring, analysing and advocating the image of the child as capable requires a recognition that children have diverse needs. This subject considers a diverse range of perspectives regarding children with special rights. A critical gaze to Western constructions of rights and the implications for alternative worldviews and experiences will be discussed. Further, working from the belief that all children have rights, this subject invites students to engage with issues of equity, social justice and inclusivity by examining policy and curriculum documents.</p>"
