        "<p>Students will learn to integrate relevant psychological and behavioural theory into a particular practice context in response to the needs of people in that context. They will learn how to consider ethical issues and practice ethically, with particular reference to standards of practice. They will also develop an understanding of multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary teams and be able to understand their own role in different professional contexts.</p>",
        "<p>Additionally, students will develop self-awareness about their own reactions to the people and systemic barriers and enablers encountered in that context. They will receive feedback on their professional attitudes and capacities as demonstrated in context.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Simulated Placement</strong></p>",
        "<p>Students are required to complete a simulated practice placement (160 accreditation hours) and will work across a range of tasks in collaboration with qualified professionals and the subject coordinator.</p>"
