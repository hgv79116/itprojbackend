        "<p>The aim of the subject is to give the students the knowledge and skills required to carry out real life software engineering projects. Students will work in large teams to develop a non-trivial software system for an external client using agile software engineering methods. Workshops are used to explore the application of advanced software engineering techniques to student projects and are drawn from topics in: analysis and modelling, product and project metrics, design and technologies, product testing and measurement and validation.</p>",
        "<p><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT</strong></p>",
        "<p>Developing real-world software on time and under budget is a challenging task. Students will work in a team to solve a practical problem, applying sound engineering principles to the formulation and solution of their problem. Students will engage in the full software engineering life cycle from requirements engineering through to delivery, to develop a software solution for an external client.</p>",
        "<p>This subject has been integrated with the Skills Towards Employment Program (STEP) and contains activities that can assist in the completion of the Engineering Practice Hurdle (EPH).</p>"
