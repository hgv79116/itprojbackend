        "<p>Students should gain an integrated understanding of selected health issues that will be explored across their breadth of complexity from molecular mechanisms through to population health considerations. Health issues include: obesity and the metabolic syndrome; stem cells, tissue engineering and emerging technologies; respiratory health and disease; and mental health.</p>",
        "<p>Students should also gain an appreciation of the research process and its relationship to the evolution of therapeutic approaches for the individual and across a population, including public health initiatives that assist in health promotion and disease control, through prevention and effective treatment.</p>"
