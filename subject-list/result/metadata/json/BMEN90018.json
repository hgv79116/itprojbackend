        "<p><strong>AIMS</strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject involves undertaking a major research or advanced innovative design project requiring an independent investigation and the preparation of reports on an approved topic. Students will present their findings in a conference presentation format, held at the end of the project cycle in the latter half of semester two.</p>",
        "<p>The emphasis of the project can be associated with either:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Explorative approach, where students will pursue outcomes associated with new knowledge or understanding within the biomedical engineering or science disciplines, often as an adjunct to existing academic research initiatives.</li><li>A well-defined innovative project, usually based on a research and development required by an external industrial client. Students will be tutored in the synthesis of practical solutions to complex technical problems within a structured working environment, as if they were research and development professional engineers.</li></ul>",
        "<p>This subject has been integrated with the Skills Towards Employment Program (STEP) and contains activities that can assist in the completion of the Engineering Practice Hurdle (EPH).</p>",
