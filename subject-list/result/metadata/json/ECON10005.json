    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject covers the core concepts which underpin quantitative decision analysis in the various specialisations within the faculty. It provides a foundation for all second-year quantitative subjects in the commerce degree. The topics covered are drawn from financial mathematics; measures of location and dispersion; probability, random variables and expected values; sampling design; estimation and testing using the normal and t-distribution; and simple regression and correlation. Excel is used to illustrate applications in accounting, economics, finance, management and marketing.</p>"
