        "<p>Exploring Numbers and Reasoning is designed for students requiring mathematical skills to provide a foundation for further academic studies. This subject covers basic mathematical and numeracy concepts in the context of academic reasoning and argument. Students will be introduced to a range of mathematical topics including basic calculations, algebra, linear equations, graphs, statistical and financial functions.</p>",
        "<p>The subject will draw on content covered in the other subjects offered as part of the DiGS Extended program to provide practical and real-life examples to utilise and reinforce mathematical concepts presented as part of the subject.</p>"
