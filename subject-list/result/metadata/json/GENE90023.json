        "<p>The Introduction to Human Genetics is a wholly online subject designed to provide students with a solid foundation of basic human genetics. The subject will cover basic genetics principles, such as the structure and function of DNA, genes and chromosomes, focussing on the human context.</p>",
        "<p>The syllabus will also cover the science underpinning human diversity and will define the various patterns of trait and disease inheritance. Finally, this subject will also describe some of the basic laboratory techniques currently used in practice.</p>",
        "<p>This introductory subject lays the foundation for further study in clinical genetics and genomics and is suitable for students with no, or limited, prior genetics training. The delivery of the subject material will be wholly online and self-directed; this allows the student to work and take assessments at their own pace.</p>"
