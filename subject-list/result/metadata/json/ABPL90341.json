    "overview": [
        "<p>Cities are home to more than half the world\u2019s population. Climate change is increasingly impacting urban areas, with urban populations exposed to more severe and frequent heatwaves, extreme weather events, flooding, bushfires, sea level rise and other climate change impacts. Climate change and urbanisation impact urban environmental systems, biodiversity, food production and water supplies. Addressing the increasing urgency and magnitude of climate change and environmental issues facing cities, towns and urban settlements globally is a high priority for urban planners and policy makers.</p>",
        "<p>The subject focuses on urban environmental policy and planning to address the impacts of urbanisation and climate change. It includes environmental policy and governance from the global to the local levels, engages with Indigenous perspectives and environmental justice, and provides case studies of environmental planning issues and responses. Topics such as nature-based solutions, biodiversity and habitat, urban water management, waste and energy are presented and discussed in an integrated manner addressing policy, planning and implementation. </p>"
