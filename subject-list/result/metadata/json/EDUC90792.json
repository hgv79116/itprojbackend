    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject develops graduate teachers\u2019 reflective dialogue through the use of evidence informed practice in teaching. Graduate teachers will take an inquiry based approach to investigate the effectiveness of their own practice, improve student learning outcomes, enhance student experience of the classroom and be relevant to the context in which they are teaching. Graduate teachers will be supported to define a question for inquiry, to develop skills to implement the investigation and to gather supportive evidence of their practice in the form of a professional portfolio. This teacher inquiry articulates with the VIT process for full registration and in many school contexts will parallel the induction process for supporting provisionally registered teachers. With assistance from a designated faculty mentor, graduate teachers select and gather evidence of practice against the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers at the proficient teacher level.</p>"
