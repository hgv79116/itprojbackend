    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces school improvement initiatives that enhance approaches to inclusion, facilitating access, participation, and progress towards educational goals for all learners. Global conventions and local legislative frameworks that support inclusive education will be explored, as will policies and resources for supporting learners with learning difficulties. Inclusive pedagogies, framed by multi-tiered program logic, will be closely examined and applied to education settings including Response to Intervention and School Wide Positive Behaviour Support. Inclusive pedagogies such as Universal Design for Learning and differentiation will be explored as ways to support the implementation of Multi-Tiered Systems of Support. Assessment tasks will include the use of school data to explore gaps between theory and practice in supporting learners with learning difficulties and an action plan for change will be developed, inclusive of collaborative practice, that will lead to improvements in teacher quality and learner outcomes.</p>"
