    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject offers students an opportunity to critically examine in detail a major legal family that is radically different from the common law. Class based discussion of the core features of the (European) civil law is built upon through independent and in-depth research exercises into selective aspects of this major family of law in the Western world today. This subject allows students to gain a deeper, and integrated, understanding of Australian law and, more generally, critically reflect upon the common law against a contemporary backdrop of globalisation. The growing importance of the legal order of the European Union will be a particular feature of examination as will be the current state of play as regards the scholarly debates concerning the various theories of convergence and divergence between legal systems. With respect to the latter, writings by outspoken scholar and critic Pierre Legrand will be scrutinised.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Comparativism and the comparative method (with particular emphasis on the problem of transplantability);</li><li>historical formation of the Romano-Germanic family of law (commencing with the fall of the Roman empire in the West in 476);</li><li>codes and codification (including a study of the 19th century conditions favouring codification and their contemporary relevance together with close scrutiny of the core features of 'substantive' \u2013 as distinct from 'formal' \u2013  codes);</li><li>selected case studies (with particular attention to core components of the law of obligations \u2013 i.e. tort and contract \u2013 as well as post-codification developments \u2013 e.g. social and consumer protection law);</li><li>impact of the legal order of the European Union as a source of supra-national law (with special focus on the tensions between so-called deepening and widening in the European integration movement as well as the distinction between the \u2018written\u2019 and 'unwritten' laws of the Union); and</li><li>theories of convergence and divergence (including their implication for the future study and development of Australian law).</li></ul>",
