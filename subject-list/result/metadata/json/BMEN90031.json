        "<p><strong>AIMS</strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject involves undertaking a major research or advanced innovative design project requiring an independent investigation and the preparation of reports on an approved topic. Students will present their findings in a conference presentation format, held at the end of the project cycle in the latter half of semester two. The emphasis of the project can be associated with either:</p>",
        "<p>Explorative approach, where students will pursue outcomes associated with new knowledge or understanding within the biomedical engineering or science disciplines, often as an adjunct to existing academic research initiatives.</p>",
        "<p>A well-defined innovative project, usually based on a research and development required by an external industrial client. Students will be tutored in the synthesis of practical solutions to complex technical problems within a structured working environment, as if they were research and development professional engineers.<br/><br/><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT</strong></p>",
        "<p>Topics include: Technical report writing, engineering design planning and conducting experiments and test, data acquisition and analysis, public speaking, project presentation skills.</p>",
        "<p>This subject has been integrated with the Skills Towards Employment Program (STEP) and contains activities that can assist in the completion of the Engineering Practice Hurdle (EPH).</p>",
        "<p><strong>Note:</strong><em> Enrolment in BMEN90031 Biomedical Engineering Capstone Project Part 1 is subject to approval from the subject coordinator. Students commence BMEN90031 Biomedical Engineering Capstone Project Part 1 in Semester 2 and then subsequently continue BMEN90032 Biomedical Engineering Capstone Project Part 2 in Semester 1 in the following year. Upon successful completion of this project, students will receive 25 points credit.</em></p>"
