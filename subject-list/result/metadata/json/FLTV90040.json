        "<p>In this subject, students will work collaboratively on a second graduate production in a selected genre on a narrative, documentary or animation short film, acting in a senior production role such as co-producer, line producer or production manager.</p>",
        "<p>Students will research and analyse the production processes relevant to their role, formally documenting their experiences.</p>",
