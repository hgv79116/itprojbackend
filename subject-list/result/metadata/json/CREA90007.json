Theories that inform mental health approaches such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and other Behavioural approaches will be highlighted.</p>",
        "<p>Students will learn about working as a creative arts therapist with people in the disability sector, including those who are disabled by diverse physical, intellectual, and mental health capacities. Distinctions between the practices of drama, dance movement, music and art therapies will be canvassed.</p>"
