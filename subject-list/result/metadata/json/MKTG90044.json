        "<p>It has become increasingly important to know how marketing actions translate into revenue and profit growth. The tools that enable this translation are part of a toolkit called \u201cMarketing Analytics.\u201d Marketing analytics is a technology-enabled and model-supported approach to harness customer and market data to enhance marketing decision-making. Within the big data phenomenon, new ways of analysing data (e.g. text mining), running social media experiments and gleaning insights on customers\u2019 digital behaviours have taken centre stage to inform business decision making. The methods that surround it, and the inferences derived from it have put marketing \u201con the map.\u201d Although these methods are here to stay, as big data becomes mainstream, it is fundamentally altering the way we collect and analyse data to demonstrate ROI.<br/>This course introduces new emerging analysis techniques and methods to deal with the analysing customer generated content (messaging, blogs, posts, reviews). This subject provides students with the basic understanding of methods and approaches to analyse digital marketing data to derive business and academic insights.</p>"
