    "overview": [
        "<p>The major focus of this course is the exploration of research evidence that informs and supports the implementation of Clinical Teaching in classroom contexts. Participants will consider how they can use evidence-based practice to enhance the effectiveness and impact of their classroom actions and identify appropriate interventions for students, when necessary. Specifically, they will use the clinical judgement decision-making model to examine the current evidence base about what works best, what criteria can be developed to make decisions about student success, and how to select, implement, review and communicate research-supported teaching strategies that address identified student needs.</p>"
