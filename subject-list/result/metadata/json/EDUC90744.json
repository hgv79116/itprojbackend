        "<p>One of the key roles of the clinical teacher is to reliably assess their learners\u2019 knowledge, skills and performance to decide whether they have achieved competence in the area of instruction. This is not just important for appropriate academic achievement and progression, but to ensure that learners are being appropriately certified as safe and competent health professionals. This subject introduces participants to the current and emerging theories underpinning valid and reliable assessment of clinical learners and provides opportunities to develop and implement clinical assessment items, as well as practical experience in assessment.</p>"
