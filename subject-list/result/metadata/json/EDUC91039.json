        "<p>The Victorian Years 7 \u2013 10 Physical Sciences Curriculum will be the content focus for this subject. Integrated with this focus, participants will also consider a range of social issues that influence science education, including gender and indigenous issues. Participants will be asked to examine participation and self-efficacy issues in science and consider ways of addressing discrepancies in the learning outcomes of these groups.</p>",
        "<p>Conceptual approaches to science understanding, including using models to assist student understanding will be discussed. Addressing common student misconceptions will also be considered through the lens of physical science. Learning sequences that assist students in overcoming problematic misconceptions will be designed and critiqued.</p>"
