    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject explores global media across different cultures. Students will engage with debates on different aspects of global cultures, including national cultural formations, institutional structures, media ownership, and transnational media. By concentrating on the effects of globalization and new information technologies in and from different geographical regions, students of Global Media Cultures will broaden their understanding of the institutional and cultural contexts of global media. This subject addresses debates on globalization, including those regarding the global-local interaction, questions of cultural agency, identity politics, and the economic and political functions of social media. The subject explores key issues on the politics of representation, paying particular attention to questions of cultural nationalism and media concentration, new technologies, and technological determinism.</p>"
