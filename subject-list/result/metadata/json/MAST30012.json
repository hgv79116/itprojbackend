    "overview": [
        "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This subject is concerned with the study of objects, which are finite in number and typically computable. At a computational level one seeks efficient algorithms and methods for construction and counting of the objects.</p>",
        "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The main topics to be covered are: enumeration, permutations, designs, finite geometry, words, Ramsey theory and physical combinatorics. Designs are relevant to statistics, Ramsey theory to computer science, and physical combinatorics to mathematical physics. Words are useful for representing and constructing objects and relating combinatorial objects to algebraic structures.</p>",
