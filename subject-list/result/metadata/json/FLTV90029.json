        "<p>Through guest lectures and industry visits, students will gain working knowledge of the various areas of film craft, that may include directing, cinematography, production and costume design, editing and sound mixing. Pre-set readings and Victorian College of the Arts (VCA) produced short films will drive online discussions, aimed at critically evaluating the creative areas relevant to the craft of filmmaking as applied in the real world filmmaking contexts.</p>",
        "<p>By the end of the subject, students will have the confidence to work closely with a wide range of creative and technical practitioners and be able to integrate their understanding of the craft elements within the filmmaking process in future filmmaking scenarios.</p>"
