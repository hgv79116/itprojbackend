    "overview": [
        "<p>This could not be a more interesting and important time to engage with some of the most challenging issues in administrative law. Australian administrative law has undergone rapid change in recent years. In significant respects it has diverged from the rest of the common law world, under the influence of the Australian Constitution. Some of the resulting doctrines are not yet in a settled state. At the same time, however, administrative law continues to play the critical role in mediating relations between people and the institutions of government that in Australia\u2019s case is heightened by the absence of systemic arrangements for the legal protection of individual rights. The two lecturers in the subject bring a combination of practical and scholarly perspectives to bear on the selected topics, all of which are chosen for their contemporary relevance.</p>",
        "<p>The subject will focus on key themes in Australian administrative law, which are likely to include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Jurisdictional error; the related notion of invalidity</li><li>Unreasonableness, irrationality and illogicality</li><li>Policy</li><li>Boundaries of judicial review</li><li>Constitutionalisation of administrative law.</li></ul>",
