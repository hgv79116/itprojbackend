        "<p>This subject introduces students to Romance-language lyric repertoire from the classical vocal tradition, focussing on musical and textual analysis, performance practice and interpretation. Students analyse texts and scores of Italian, French and Spanish art songs and other lyric repertoire in their historical, musical, and literary contexts. The practical component enables students to apply analytical skills to performance and to develop stylistically authentic and effective interpretations. Coaching and peer interactions establish a positive and collaborative ensemble environment. </p>"
