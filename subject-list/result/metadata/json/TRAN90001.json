        "<p>Students are introduced to the major theoretical and methodological approaches for evaluating the results of translation and interpreting as textual products, including the social and cultural embedding of those products, how they are received, how they can be evaluated, and how they concern the ethics of the translation and interpreting professions. Through seminars, class activities and readings, students gain insight into the central issues in product-based translation studies. The focus is on building the knowledge and analytical skills required for the production of successful translations and interpreting renditions<em>.  </em></p>"
