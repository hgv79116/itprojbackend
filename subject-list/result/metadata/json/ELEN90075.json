        "<p><strong>AIMS</strong></p>",
        "<p>The aim of this subject is to understand the fundamental concepts and basic theory involved in modelling and analysis of the power electronic components that comprise power electronic devices such as power supplies, inverters, converters and their control systems. It is expected that at the end of this subject the student has a sound understanding of the physical concepts and mathematical models behind each of the basic components and of their functionality within a system, such as a high voltage DC transmission system. Furthermore this subject seeks to combine the fields of electronics, semiconductor devices, power system operation, power system measurement and control. It is expected that through this subject the students are exposed to examples of real electrical engineering systems where the three disciplines of electronics, power systems and control come together. <br/><br/><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT</strong></p>",
        "<p>Topics covered in this subject include: introduction to power semiconductor switches; discussion on the role of power electronics in the operation of electric power systems; models of power semiconductor devices and circuit components, including diodes, Thyristors, IGBT, Snubber circuits. Also basic concepts of single- and three-phase diode bridge rectifiers; single- and three-phase converters and inverters; operation and design of DC-AC inverters with emphases on switch-mode inverters, i.e. single- and three-phase inverters. Finally, the acquired knowledge of power electronic devices is applied to wind and PV solar systems where the design of voltage source converters and associated control loops are used to interface the wind/solar system with the power grid.</p>"
