    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will examine the importance of enduring and evolving ideas in architecture, design, culture, technology, practice and history from the 18<sup>th</sup> century to the 20<sup>th</sup> century. The subject will include study of the following historical ideas and exemplars:</p>",
        "<p>enlightenment, the rise of archaeology and neo-classicism; the emerging language of Modernity including the picturesque and revivalism; the industrial revolution and its implications for re-thinking cities and labour in relation to design and production; documenting the modern metropolis; colonialism and imperialism; structure and decoration. Historical precedents will be considered within their social, cultural, environmental and landscape contexts. They will be further analysed and visualised according to how we understand, remember and experience historical buildings and places into the present day through canonical endurance and challenge, revivalism, documentation, conservation and restoration, archives and museums. International influence and exchange will be examined through comparison to Australian and local significant sites and buildings.</p>"
