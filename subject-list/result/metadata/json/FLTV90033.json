    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will offer students greater insight to the new horizons of screen producing for multi-platform approaches. Screen producing as it was in the twentieth century has been forever disrupted in the twenty-first. The once standard 'industrial model' exemplified by the studio system has been diminished by the impact of new technologies and an evolving social awareness of the need for diverse voices and alternative approaches to storytelling and program making.</p>",
        "<p>Drawing on the knowledge and experience of industry guest speakers and case studies, students will explore approaches to producing that range from the traditional white-western 'auteur' model to the more varied and distinct. Students will study diverse cultural voices and participatory models of screen-making that are made possible in the digital realm, along with the parallel modes of gaming and virtual reality. </p>",
        "<p>Students will research and explore across this spectrum to identify the methodologies and philosophies that best suit the producer's work in and across different spheres.</p>"
