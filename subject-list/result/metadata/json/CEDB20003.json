    "overview": [
        "<p>The subject builds on the basic cell biology concepts introduced in first year biology and develops students\u2019 understanding of the processes that regulate the structure and function of eukaryotic cells. Using examples from plant and animal cells, the subject will outline the cellular structures and molecular processes that are fundamental for regulating cell function in multicellular organisms. It will also explore the external signals (physical, molecular, electrochemical) that can lead to changes in cell behaviour, gene expression, protein synthesis or cell replication.</p>"
