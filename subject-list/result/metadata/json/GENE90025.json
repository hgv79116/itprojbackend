        "<p>Clinical Genome Variant Analysis 2 is designed to broaden and further develop the basic understanding and principles of variant interpretation taught in Clinical Genome Variant Analysis 1. Application of software and genomic database for collation of evidence for interpretation will be covered in detail.</p>",
        "<p>The subject will be taught as an intensive, blended (on-line and face-to-face) subject, commencing in the first half of the semester.</p>",
        "<p>The subject provides a sound foundation for participation in multidisciplinary clinical discussions on genomic testing and analysis, and would be useful preparatory learning for laboratory scientists and clinical staff training in variant interpretation.</p>",
        "<p>Completion of Clinical Genome Variant Analysis 1 to a grade of 70% or higher is a prerequisite for this subject.</p>"
