    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will enable students to integrate and extend prior knowledge on lifestyle and wellness behaviours to effectively and safely support optimal health of individuals, groups and specific populations across the lifespan and along the health and impairment continuum. Students will draw critically on the evidence for lifestyle behaviours needed for good health with an emphasis on the recommendations for physical activity and exercise.  Students will also explore health risks due to sedentary behaviour and other lifestyle choices (such as poor diet, sleep hygiene and stress), and investigate current options for delivery and evaluation of programs to manage these risks and incorporate evidence informed behavioural interventions to promote optimal health. Students will build on their clinical reasoning skills to theorise the mechanism of an individuals' health deficits from an holistic, patient-centred, biopsychosocial perspective, and design a plan that includes a physical activity program plus other lifestyle changes to meet the goals of optimal health outcomes for an individual. Students will be expected to be critical in their analysis and evaluations of new and emerging evidence base around lifestyle choices.</p>",
        "<p>All students will complete a Foundational module (Weeks 1-3) that will explore the pathophysiological and psychosocial theory of rehabilitation and evidence\u2013based health outcomes of lifestyle and wellness behaviours with an emphasis on physical activity but also including other healthy lifestyle choices. A biopsychosocial framework will emphasise the biological, mechanical, social, psychological and cultural elements that influence health and health-enhancing behaviour.</p>",
        "<p>Students will then choose three from five modules that best meets their learning interests and/or practice needs. These modules are:</p>",
        "<ol><li>Evidence.<br/>This module is recommended for all students unless they have prior research or systematic review experience. The module will focus on developing skills to search for, evaluate and synthesise the evidence base on the efficacy of physical activity, exercise, and other lifestyle behaviour programs that reflect the practice interests of students. Students will appraise both qualitative and quantitative evidence on selected programs for specified populations, including programs that support current exercise and physical activity guidelines and priorities. Students will practice framing a question, writing a search strategy, evaluating (appraising) the findings, synthesising the information, and considering application to their clinical practice.<br/><br/></li><li>Fitness, Physical Activity and Exercise.<br/>This module will cover the body systems and functions that contribute to strength and fitness. The primary focus will be on building knowledge of the different types of exercise activity (cardio-vascular, fitness, strength, flexibility) and how these might be used to achieve different outcomes. The module will also cover measurement of physical activity and exercise tolerance along the lifespan and the health and impairment continuum, including the role of new emerging innovations and technology tools that support current exercise and physical activity guidelines and priorities.<br/><br/></li><li>Optimising health for the Adult/Older Population.<br/>This module will address the assessment and analyses of health-related needs for adults/older adults including the selection of appropriate exercise interventions. Students will compare and contrast the personal and environmental circumstances that influence participation preferences of adults/older adults within diverse practice contexts, and take an holistic person-centred approach to planning a program for optimising health.<br/><br/></li><li>Children.<br/>This module will address the assessment and analyses of health-related movement needs for children and the selection of appropriate advice and interventions. The 24hr recommendations for the early years initially developed in Canada form the basis for this module. This approach is an integration of physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and sleep recommendations. Students will also compare and contrast the personal and environmental circumstances that influence participation preferences of children within diverse practice contexts.<br/><br/></li><li>Community Approaches to Physical Activity/Inactivity.<br/>In this module, students will use some provided case scenarios to identify and analyse typical community-based and community-wide activity and exercise programs designed for individuals or groups across the lifespan. They will consider the influences of the environment, such as evidence for the role of the green environment and urban planning, in providing the space and motivation to engage in physical activity within the community. Finally, they will consider technological innovations, such as portable, wearable technologies, regularly used in the community setting.</li></ol>",
        "<p>The final integration module will be completed by all students. Students will consider their role, in terms of their health profession and practice context, in facilitating healthier lifestyles and improved wellbeing of their patients/clients. The final module (Week 8) will also focus on the design and evaluation of an holistic lifestyle intervention to meet the needs of an individual or a group with common impairments or health needs. Students will apply a model of rehabilitation best practice and using an ICF informed framework, in the execution of this task.</p>",
        "<p>In this subject, students will also reflect on their personal attitudes to lifestyle choices and the privilege of their background and opportunities. They will concisely and effectively communicate their understanding of the range of options their patients/clients, in their particular practice context(s), have to improve their health and wellbeing.</p>"
