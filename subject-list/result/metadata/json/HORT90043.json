        "<p>This subject aims to provide students with a thorough understanding of the tree selection and tree identification principles. Students should be able to recognise trees commonly used in landscape horticulture and correctly write their botanical, common and family names and describe tree form and tolerances. They should be able to write plant names in accordance with the ICN (International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants) and the ICNCP (International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants). The subject will be delivered through attendance at a six day intensive workshop.</p>"
