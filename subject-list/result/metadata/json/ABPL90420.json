    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject focuses on the interaction between users and the built environment and explores how technology changes the ways we create and use space. The emphasis is on the correlation between architectural design, computational techniques and mechatronics. Students will be thought innovative ways of studying the built environment (acquiring data to inform the design process) and will be introduced to automated procedures of creating spatial change (using sensor/actuator technologies). </p>",
        "<p>In addition to well-known and visually based techniques traditionally used by designers, the subject focuses on the creative potential of information invisible to a human eye. A vast amount of environmental and behavioural data is collected by sensory devices distributed in buildings and public spaces in cities around the world. In the future, even more, real-time data on how the built environment is used and how climatic conditions influence their use will be available. Some of the exciting creative research indicates that there is a high potential for such data to turn into design intelligence and tap into dynamic architectural projects. Throughout the semester, students will be developing a project employing design strategies based on the information obtainable by sensory devices.</p>"
