    "overview": [
        "<p>Regulation has become a permanent feature of the way in which contemporary democratic economies, including Australia, are governed. There are few spheres of economic activity that are not subject to some form of regulatory oversight and control. Daily news programs rarely pass without some mention of a significant regulatory decision, proposed regulatory reform or allegations of some regulatory failure or scandal. For lawyers, dealings with regulators and regulatory regimes have become part of the staple diet of their work. Yet the practice of regulation is far from straightforward. Regulatory policy and practice has evolved considerably from its traditional origins in the form of \u2018command and control\u2019, accompanied by the growth of specific terminology and concepts that are likely to be unfamiliar to those other than regulatory technocrats. This subject provides an opportunity for students to develop an understanding of, and critically to evaluate, the basic tools, techniques and decision-making methodologies that are employed in regulatory design and practice. It will be of interest to both private and public sector lawyers who practise in regulated sectors of the economy, enhancing their understanding of how regulators go about the business of regulatory decision-making.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Introduction: What is \u2018regulation\u2019 and \u2018governance\u2019?; the regulatory agency: institutional features, strengths and shortcomings; the rise of the \u2018regulatory state\u2019; regulatory regimes and the role of non-state actors</li><li>Tools, techniques and instruments of regulation: command\u2014traditional legal prohibitions backed by sanctions; competition\u2014market based approaches; communication\u2014information disclosure and publicity-based approaches; consensus (including self-regulation); code architecture and the use of \u2018nudge\u2019 techniques</li><li>\u2018New governance\u2019 approaches to regulation: choice of Instrument; \u2018hybrid\u2019 approaches to regulation; responsive regulation, \u2018smart regulation\u2019 and its variants (including meta-regulation); algorithmic regulation, cost-benefit analysis and regulatory impact assessment and \u2018better regulation\u2019</li><li>Enforcement and compliance: problems with rules; principles-based regulation; the role of the criminal and civil law; punitive civil sanctions (the Macrory Review); regulatory enforcement styles; national styles of regulation; private enforcement, third party monitoring and certification systems and the role of technological instruments for monitoring and control.</li><li>Appraising Regulation: regulatory accountability; regulatory legitimacy: between democracy and expertise.</li></ul>"
