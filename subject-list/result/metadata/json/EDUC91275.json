        "<p>In this third learning area subject, Interns will consolidate their understandings of the theory and practice of teaching, and the Clinical Teaching Model, with particular attention given to the critique of contemporary issues and debates on Health Education within Australia and beyond. Through this subject, Interns are supported to become reflective teachers of Health Education with an understanding of relevant and appropriate sources of professional learning for teachers. Interns are also supported to become critical, informed members of the school community who are able to reflect on school and education curriculum and policies, as well as the resources and infrastructure available for Health Education.</p>",
        "<p>The assessment tasks in this subject will support Interns in strengthening their skills in identifying and adapting appropriate pedagogical practices to differentiate teaching and meet the specific needs of students of diverse backgrounds and abilities, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, as well as critiquing and responding to key educational issues that impact on teaching and learning.</p>"
