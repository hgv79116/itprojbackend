        "<p>Digitalisation affects all aspects of the value chain and all levels of business. This subject embraces the wide range of industrial developments related to digital transformation such as industrial internet-of-things (IIOT) and digital twins. Digital transformation of industrial systems is defined as the application of digital information (from multiple sources, formats, owners) for the enhancement of manufacturing processes, value chains, products and services.</p>",
        "<p>This subject consists of four modules. The first module provides an overview of the technologies, approaches, applications and rationale for modern digital systems deployments in industry. The following three modules then focus on three distinct dimensions to digital transformation in industrial systems that have been identified: Vertical Systems Integration (connecting production to the business), Horizontal Systems Integration (connecting a manufacturer to suppliers, customers and partners) and End-To-End Systems Integration (connecting concept, design, prototype and product development).  Each of these modules will examine industrial challenges, solution areas, relevant technologies and applications.</p>"
