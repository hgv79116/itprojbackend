    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides a detailed investigation of human locomotor anatomy. The subject will cover terminology of human topographic anatomy as it relates to the back, neck and limbs; the functional anatomy of the back, neck, upper and lower limbs; the principles underlying human gait and locomotion; the neural control of gait and locomotion; and the design of artificial joints. Lectures on anatomy will be supplemented by specialist lectures by practitioners to demonstrate the disciplinary breadth achievable with anatomical knowledge. Cadaveric dissection will be used to complement learning, by exposing the boundaries and contents of important regions of the back, neck and limbs; and anatomical models, computer programs, prosected specimens and modern imaging techniques will be used to appreciate anatomical structures.</p>"

        "Describe the organisation of the human locomotor system; the factors responsible for stability of the vertebral column and head; the functional anatomy of the back, neck and limbs; the organisation of the bones, joints, muscles, fascia, nerves and vessels of the neck, back, upper and lower limbs; radiological anatomy of the back, neck and limbs; gait and locomotion; central nervous system control of movement; and the design and reconstruction of artificial joints and limbs",
        "Articulate the mechanical, clinical, radiological, evolutionary and forensic applications of human locomotor anatomy",
        "Differentiate and describe the muscle belly, tendons, proximal and distal attachment of all major muscles of the trunk and extremities; locate major ligaments and articular capsules of the major joints of the trunk and extremities; describe the shape of the joint surfaces and relate this to the type of joint, degrees of freedom, and possible motions parallel with the cardinal planes; distinguish and define the major arteries and veins of the back, neck and limbs; recognize and locate all major nerves and plexi of the locomotor system; distinguish and describe on models and prosections, bony, ligamentous, muscular, tendinous, nervous and vascular structures",
        "Demonstrate observational and organisational skills to interpret exposed anatomical structures and regions of the back, neck and limbs",
        "Demonstrate written and oral communication skills to describe normal and impaired anatomical structures of the human locomotor system"
