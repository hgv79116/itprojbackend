        "<p>This subject is designed for students who have completed Ancient Egyptian 1 and 2 or the equivalent. In this subject, further work is undertaken on writing, grammar and syntax to revise, consolidate and extend students' knowledge of the language and its complex script, with the aim of enabling students to translate Egyptian hieroglyphic texts critically and independently. In particular, this subject focuses on a thorough overview of the Egyptian verbal system. Students are exposed to increasingly difficult texts (some now consisting of multiple sentences) from a variety of sources.</p>",
        "<p>Background information on ancient Egyptian culture is woven into the subject matter throughout the semester. By the end of the subject, students should have a sufficient grasp of the language and script to read literary and non-literary Middle Egyptian hieroglyphic texts of moderate difficulty solely with the aid of a dictionary and reference-grammar. Students who successfully complete this subject may progress to Ancient Egyptian 4.</p>"
