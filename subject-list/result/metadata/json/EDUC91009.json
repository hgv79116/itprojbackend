        "<p>Note that students will not be allowed to undertake any project that involves the collection of primary data that requires Human Research Ethics Approval. </p>",
        "<p>Students will demonstrate their ability to define a problem, review relevant theoretical and practical literature, design an approach and apply it to their defined problem. Students will present their scholarly findings in a conference presentation format (designed for the subject) that facilitates peer learning and fosters professional alliances and networks.</p>"
