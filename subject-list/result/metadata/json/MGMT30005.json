    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject explores different models of strategy making and examines some of the difficulties involved in managing strategic change. Traditional models see strategy making as a straightforward, rational, 'top-down' process. Empirical work shows, however, that the formulation and implementation of strategies is a complex process, which is affected by political, cognitive, and contextual factors. Top managers can formulate a detailed strategic plan; but plans are not always put into practice nor are the plans that are put into practice necessarily successful. The subject commences by reviewing traditional models of strategy making where strategies are formed to derive a competitive advantage that enables the organisation to respond to environmental threats and opportunities. Students will then be introduced to other models, including institutional, ecological, competitive, value-driven and critical perspectives, to explore how strategic change is managed.</p>"
