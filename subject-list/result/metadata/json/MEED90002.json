        "<p>This capstone subject will provide students with an opportunity to consolidate their learning for further intellectual and professional growth through an advanced industry placement in a healthcare setting. As part of this subject, students will undertake a supervised internship placement which will be organised by the student, the host organisation, and the Subject Coordinator. Students will apply their academic knowledge to real-world challenges associated with clinical research and gain professional skills by undertaking an industry placed project. Engagement in this subject will enable students to bridge the gap between the classroom and clinical research setting. Moreover, it will enable students to develop contacts with experts working in their preferred research settings and will facilitate them to achieve a range of transferable skills including developing an employment/work portfolio.</p>"
