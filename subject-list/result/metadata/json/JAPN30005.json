    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is designed for students who have completed Japanese 6 and can recognise around 600 kanji characters, or those who have similar experience. This subject will enhance students\u2019 academic literacy skills to conduct research related to Japan/Japanese. Students will establish advanced Japanese literacy and background knowledge in order to engage in international issues surrounding Japan. Students will develop understanding of various genres through reading, and discussing issues in modern Japanese society. Students will be engaged in a small scale research project on chosen topics by further investigating the issue and by writing an opinion piece and presenting it to the class. Through the research project they will develop their research skills and will equip themselves with critical literacy by analysing issues in question from various perspectives and participating in small group discussions.</p>"
