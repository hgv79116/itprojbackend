    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject builds upon the knowledge and skills developed in <em>EDUC90885 Introduction to Clinical Practice</em> and <em>EDUC90880</em><em> Integrating Clinical Practice</em> to support Teacher Candidates to become clinical practitioners. In so doing, Teacher Candidates will demonstrate their use of the Clinical Teaching Cycle as a guide to interventionist assessment and pedagogical and instructional decision-making. Specifically, Teacher Candidates will demonstrate growing proficiency in orchestrating inclusive classrooms, differentiating instruction and adjusting teaching to meet the needs of learners. In becoming clinical practitioners, Teacher Candidates will also develop capabilities which will prepare them to identify the scope of learning needs within a student group; the suitability of evidence collection for informing clinical judgement; and evidence-based learning progressions. The theme of the content presented in this core subject is \u2018student data and interventionist practice\u2019.</p>"
