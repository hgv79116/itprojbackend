    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces students to the diverse ways in which the competing needs and interests of organisations, employees, communities and other stakeholders are managed in the 21st century workplace. The globalisation of production, technological change, and new business models have created new jobs and occupations and destroyed or transformed old ones, altered the extent to which work provides economic security and meaning and given rise to new conflict at work. This subject analyses the consequences of these developments for the experience of work and conflict, as well as the diversity of national institutions and organisational approaches to manage the same problems. Emerging challenges for organisations and managers are considered, including automation, demographic changes, insecurity, and identity at work.</p>"
