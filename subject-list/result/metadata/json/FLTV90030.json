An historical overview of storytelling leads to an investigation of conventions and tropes in story and then into script structure and style, including key concepts such as themes, premise, plot and character.</p>",
        "<p>Students will develop script literacy to help them work collaboratively with screenwriters, and to effectively play the producer's unique role in script development. Practical exercises in script analysis and in exploring the producer/writer relationship will give students experience as active participants and leaders in the creative development process.</p>"
