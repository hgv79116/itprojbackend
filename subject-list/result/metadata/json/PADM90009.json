    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides students with an advanced understanding of ethics as they apply to the individual in their managerial role, but also in the design and implementation of public outcomes more broadly. This subject situates these challenges in their social, theoretical, historical and disciplinary contexts to provide participants with a strong foundation for their application in practice. The subject draws in particular on key ideas from philosophy to guide participants in working ethically as individual managers and leaders, but also more broadly facing the ethical dilemmas that managers confront in complex policy and governing environments. It will place a particular emphasis on the complex relationship between scientific advancement and the challenges this poses to policy makers and public managers.<br/><br/><em>Working Ethically</em> is one of the core subjects in the Melbourne School of Government's Public Administration program. It is one of three professionally-oriented subjects and it builds on <em>The World of Public Administration</em> and the core discipline subjects to develop the professional skills of participants with a particular focus on ethics.</p>"
