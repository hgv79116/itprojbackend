    "overview": [
        "<p>Climate change is a pressing environmental, economic and social problem. Global warming is predicted to have wide-ranging impacts, and it presents enormous challenges for conventional models of law and socio-economic governance due to its pervasive character, long-term effects and the need for dynamic change in many of the fundamental areas of life. This subject examines the challenges for law in driving that change, from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its associated Paris Agreement, to international trade, climate finance and litigation, to federal and state legislative responses, through to local effects including relating to Indigenous peoples. The lecturer is active in research and advice in climate change law and governance in the international and domestic law spheres.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>The scientific basis for global warming and physical impacts of climate change</li><li>The international legal framework, including the UNFCCC, Kyoto Protocol, Paris Agreement and associated international instruments</li><li>Social and cultural impacts and legal responses, such as human rights protection</li><li>Climate finance and schemes for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD).</li><li>The role of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in climate change governance, particularly with respect to renewable energy technologies and the disciplining of fossil fuel subsidies</li><li>The interaction of climate change regimes with other international law frameworks; eg World Heritage, refugee law, human rights and security</li><li>The federal legislative framework for climate change mitigation and adaptation, including direct action plans, market mechanisms and carbon trading</li><li>State-based legislative and regulatory responses to climate change</li><li>Bio-sequestration and carbon capture and storage</li><li>The nature of climate change litigation</li></ul>"
