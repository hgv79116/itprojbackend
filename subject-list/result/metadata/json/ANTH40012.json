    "overview": [
        "<p>The focus of this subject is on the skills entailed in qualitative research projects that seek to understand and explain social and cultural phenomena. It introduces students to various approaches to socio-cultural research and their ethical and methodological implications, particularly in cross-cultural contexts. Students will workshop specific projects, as well as examining a range of qualitative research methods. On completion of this subject students should have the ability to design an original research project of their own, justifying the methodological and ethical approach to be taken.</p>"
