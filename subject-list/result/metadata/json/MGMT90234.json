        "<p>How are successful cultural businesses built? How do we understand the business of art and culture, and what is the role of leadership and entrepreneurialism in the cultural sector? Florence has been famous as a centre of European culture, industry, trade and finance through the ages. The Florentine industrial district provides a model of development that we can draw on today to inform understandings of contemporary finance, marketing and customer service. Taught on location in Florence, this subject examines both the unique Florentine complex of cultural and commercial interests, and also other Australian and European approaches to the creation of business models in the arts and cultural sectors. Through case studies, site visits and industry comparisons, it explores how to build business models that can go from good to great.</p>",
