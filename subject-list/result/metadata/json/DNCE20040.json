        "<p>The Travelling Studio is a place-based 3 week intensive study experience, linking content to local land, environment and place. Students will travel within Australia to one or two city, town or community destinations where they will have first-hand experience with local historical and contemporary practices, engage in a dance residency and/or festival and undertake masterclasses.</p>",
        "<p>Learning from experts in the field and/or industry professionals, students are exposed to innovations and gain valuable experience contributing to their identity as dance makers and artists. Students will be challenged to think beyond their current dance practice by engaging with environment, community and participating in workshops reflecting on their place and role within national, local and regional movement cultures.</p>",
        "<p>Group travel as part of a mobile academy builds resilience and capability in resourceful dancing. On their return to Melbourne students present a performative demonstration and portfolio of their learning.</p>"
