    "overview": [
        "<p>The aim of this subject is to enable students to understand and apply the principles of design and analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) within the educational context. The subject provides a comprehensive introduction to trial design features used to limit bias, essential aspects of trial design, conduct, analysis and reporting, and challenges and solutions for conducting RCTs within the education context. At the end of the subject, it is expected that students will be able to contribute effectively to the planning, conduct and reporting of an RCT within an education context.                                      </p>",
        "<p>Throughout the subject, the emphasis will be on practical issues faced by researchers in the conduct of RCTs in education, and participants will be provided with skills to design and conduct rigorous RCTs in this research area. This subject covers: when is an RCT design appropriate, ethical considerations, principles and methods of randomisation in controlled trials, types of RCTs, allocation to groups, outcome measurements, understanding implementation and process measures, cost-analysis, statistical approaches, data interpretation and reporting.</p>"
