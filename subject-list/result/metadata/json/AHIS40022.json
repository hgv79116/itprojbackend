    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is taught on location in a major art centre using the social, economic, geographical and cultural effects of the art centre as a case study of historical and contemporary culture. Students will be introduced to the key institutional components of an art centre: as appropriate, museums, galleries, alternative spaces, corporate collections, auction houses, art magazines and studios. These will be analysed using models derived from discourse theory, the institutional model of art, urban sociology, psycho geography, architectural history and subcultural theory. Students will study the display and consumption of art, allowing consideration of recent developments in museology, arts policy, commodity theory and cultural tourism.</p>",
