        "<p>This subject will provide students with an overview of research methods used in music therapy. This will include understanding different worldviews and the beliefs and values that are congruent with diverse approaches to research. Students will be challenged to consider the relevance of different approaches for discovering new knowledge relevant to music therapy.</p>",
        "<p>Assessment will include: a written report, evaluating the quality of two research articles using appropriate assessment criteria, a written research proposal for a specified music therapy program as well as completing a modified research ethics application for the proposed project.</p>",
        "<p>Note: This subject is offered in two cohorts:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Melbourne based students attend on-campus classes and activities</li><li>Interstate or regional students attend online classes and activities, and on-campus intensives in Melbourne</li></ul>"
