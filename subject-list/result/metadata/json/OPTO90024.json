        "<p>Note: This subject is only available to students enrolled in the Doctor of Optometry.</p>",
        "<p>This subject provides training in the optometric procedures for the examination of the eyes and introduces common vision and ocular disorders. On completion of the subject, students will be able to investigate a patient\u2019s visual problems, make a diagnosis, and plan an appropriate course of management for common conditions. Topics include: refractive anomalies of the eye, including explanations of the origin and development of refractive anomalies and the approaches used to detect and correct refractive errors; anomalies of accommodation, including presbyopia; anomalies of ocular motility and binocular vision, including their clinical assessment and management; and the detection and basis of disorders of the visual pathway. Practical sessions introduce students to taking and recording a routine patient history, investigating an ocular complaint, completing a comprehensive refractive examination, performing a routine screen to detect overt visual dysfunction. Additionally, students will work in small groups to link themes in basic vision science with clinical practice.</p>"
