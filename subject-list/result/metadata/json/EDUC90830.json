        "<p>This subject focuses on the theoretical frameworks and evidence bases that educators use in understanding the development of their students and in planning suitable instructional sequences that are responsive to the inherent variability of learners. It covers foundational concepts related to learning environments, learning processes and child and adolescent development. It also provides opportunities to explore and discuss implications for teaching that are related to the consideration of learners\u2019 profiles of capabilities and how teachers facilitate the quality, depth and active nature of their learning.</p>"
