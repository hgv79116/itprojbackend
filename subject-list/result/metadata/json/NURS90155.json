    "overview": [
        "<p>The subject aims to help students develop knowledge, skill and application within the context of nursing care provided to clients/patients experiencing acute health problems. Students will develop their capabilities in client/patient assessment, data collection, nursing problem identification and evidence-based application of relevant nursing interventions. Students will develop abilities to work in interprofessional collaboration with medicine and allied health to deliver safe, effective, evidence-based collaborative care.</p>",
        "<p>Throughout the subject there will be a focus on examining the health care system, including digital health components, from the perspective of factors that can affect patient outcomes and the importance of identifying, critically appraising and integrating evidence into clinical practice. Using safety and quality as a framework student will examine trends in critical incidents that result in adverse outcomes for patients locally and globally. They will also be introduced to emerging strategies in health care that seek to improve safety and quality and consider the role of the nurse in leading these efforts at a clinical and organisational level.</p>"
