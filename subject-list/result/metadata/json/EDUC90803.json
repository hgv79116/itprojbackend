        "<p>Pedagogy into Practice is designed to deepen the basic educational theories encountered in the first year of study and to enhance participants\u2019 ability to develop and implement curriculum content. It provides and develops a general conceptual framework for understanding learning and teaching specific to clinical contexts. It examines how learning can be enhanced from a range of theoretical and evidence-based perspectives.</p>",
        "<p>Participants will analyse student characteristics to identify learning and teaching strategies that build on individual students\u2019 prior experiences and learning. Participants will investigate the strategic role of the teacher in effective student learning, planning for learning, group teaching, developing a culture of learning and building relationships. There will be strong emphasis on linkages to the clinical environment and critical reflection as a paradigm for teacher self-evaluation and professional learning.</p>"
