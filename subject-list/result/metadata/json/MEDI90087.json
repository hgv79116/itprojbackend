        "<p>The Cancer in Society subject aims to provide students with a holistic understanding of the cancer burden in modern society. This will include a detailed review of the epidemiology of cancer and how this varies internationally. Students will explore the attitudes, behaviours and risk factors that influence cancer incidence, morbidity and mortality. They will also examine the influence of the commercial sector, law and public policy on cancer mortality and morbidity. Social, political and financial considerations of cancer care will also be addressed.</p>"
