    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject deals with the critical formulation of vanguard \u201chigh\u201d modernism in the 1960s and its contestation by varieties of late modernist and postmodernist art and culture, which develop throughout subsequent decades up to the millennium.</p>",
        "<p>Students will explore the language and methods for critically describing and interpreting works of art, using examples from the postmodern era. Through study of select works of art, historical, social, cultural and political contexts underpinning artistic production in the postmodern era are introduced.</p>",
        "<p>This subject develops from Critical and Theoretical Studies 1 and 2, examining more advanced modes of critical interpretation in the visual arts. Critical and Theoretical Studies 3 includes an embedded program in academic literacy skills in analysis, discussion, essay writing, research and information retrieval, and is designed to complement accompanying studio-based programs.</p>"
