    "overview": [
        "<p>Geoscience is the scientific study of the Earth and the complex processes that have shaped our planet. Interactions between the rocks, water, climate and life are recorded in the rock record over the Earth\u2019s 4.6 billion year history. Geoscience is a key part of our everyday life, not only because it solves real world problems, but because our rocky environment forms many wonders of the world we live in. This subject will allow students to gain a deeper understanding of the processes controlling the geological and environmental evolution of Planet Earth.  Experience a three-day field trip that provides hands-on and employment-focused investigations of Victoria\u2019s geology and physical environment.  </p>",
        "<p><br/>We will explore the origin of Earth as a planet within the Solar System. We will study the formation of Earth\u2019s layers and the dynamic processes that cause earthquakes and volcanoes and their impacts. The evolution of Earth\u2019s continents, oceans and mountain belts and their changes through geological time will be revealed. Fossils will be studied that provide evidence for the origin and evolution of life, including radiations and mass extinctions. By studying Earth surface processes, we will delve into past landscapes, ecosystems and climate variability. The study of Earth\u2019s past climate is key to better predict future climate change. We aim to understand the geological mechanisms that regulate the long-term climate system. </p>"
