        "<p>The subject is a critical introduction to the contemporary tools and urban models that are required in the practice of urban design. The theoretical focus is on contemporary techniques and models that have been generated by architects, landscape architects , urban designers, planners and other built environment professionals.<br/>It emphasises links between eras (continuities and change), between ideas and practice, and between urban design and the wider landscape of ideas: special attention is paid to the influence of culture, the role and techniques of urban morphology, and the graphic representation/interpretation of concepts, models and places.</p>"
