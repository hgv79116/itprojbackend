        "<p>Mineral and petroleum resources play a significant part in the Australian economy. The exploitation of these resources involves governments, as proprietors and regulators, together with private enterprise, as explorers and developers. The complex relationship between governments and private enterprise includes several fiscal components: State and Territory royalties and stamp duties; Commonwealth income tax, GST, customs and excise, and \u2018carbon taxes\u2019; and \u2018special\u2019 Commonwealth levies, such as the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax and the Minerals Resource Rent Tax. Australia\u2019s federal system of government adds an important dimension to that relationship.</p>",
