    "overview": [
        "<p>Urban areas are a complex interplay between social systems and the range of physical, economic, ecological and other forces that act upon them. Successful urban planning depends upon the comprehensive understanding of the social dimension of urban places. This subject provides theoretical and applied instruction in how to design, conduct and analyse social research related to urban planning and development. The workshop will integrate ethics, theory, principles of research and methods/tools with applied planning examples, giving students an opportunity to explore research foundations in a practice-relevant learning environment.</p>",
        "<p>Students will develop the necessary skills to design, execute and analyse a substantial urban planning research project and to provide results/analysis in ways suitable for a range of users including the public, other planners and urban managers.</p>"
