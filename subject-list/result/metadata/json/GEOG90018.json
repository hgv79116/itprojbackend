    "overview": [
        "<p>We rarely reflect on the evolution of thinking within an academic discipline and the circumstances prevailing both within and beyond the academy at times of disciplinary upheaval. This subject explores the history and philosophy of geography. It introduces students to key debates and developments in geographical thought, and how these govern the nature and scope of geography as an academic discipline. Through a series of workshops and readings, students will discover what drives contemporary research in human and physical geography. The subject highlights: the important role that geographers play in interdisciplinary research and their ability to bridge the social-physical science divide; notions of research culture/environment; and wider societal contexts that affect and are affected by disciplinary change. In addition to benchmark papers, students will critically evaluate how contemporary geographic research is communicated orally via research seminars within the School and across the university. Students completing this subject will be able to think critically about different branches of geographical thought; evaluate theoretical concepts from geography and elsewhere; and demonstrate an understanding of the dynamic and contested nature of the discipline. Students will also gain insights into a selected issue at a leading edge of contemporary geographical research.</p>"
