        "<p>Foundations in Paediatric Nursing is designed to promote an understanding of the theoretical foundations of Paediatric nursing to support safe practice when caring for paediatric patients. Students will explore growth and development principles from newborn to the adolescent and explore assessment and management of the paediatric patient.  The impact of hospitalisation on the child and family unit will also be examined. Interventions initiated by nurses at a beginning level of specialist paediatric practice will be explored, including the technical and scientific knowledge that is a pre-requisite for skill development. The evidence base underpinning practice will be evaluated.</p>"
