    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject explores the content and pedagogical content needed to teach the <em>Statistics and Probability</em> strand in the Years 7-10 mathematics curriculum. There will be a focus on the importance of teaching in context and on developing students\u2019 ability to communicate quantitative information clearly and correctly. Current challenges, issues and opportunities in teaching <em>Statistics and Probability</em> will be addressed. The notion of statistical literacy will be considered and participants will develop teaching strategies to develop students\u2019 critical thinking and ability to discuss, display and interpret quantitative data. The use of digital technology for teaching <em>Statistics and Probability</em> will be explored.</p>",
        "<p>Participants will study research on misconceptions commonly associated with <em>Statistics and Probability</em> and effective teaching methods. Development of the proficiencies of fluency, understanding, reasoning and problem solving will be considered in the context of the subject content. The role of assessment, effective teacher questioning, use of real-world examples and the orchestration of classroom discussion to promote learning is a focus. Approaches for planning investigations will be addressed. Practical teaching tasks will complement theory.</p>"
