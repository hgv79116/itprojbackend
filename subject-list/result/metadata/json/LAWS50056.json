    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces students to the emerging, specialised field of climate change law and regulation, covering domestic, transnational and international legal dimensions. It develops and integrates legal knowledge from across many sub-disciplinary legal fields (e.g. administrative law and torts law), augmenting this through study of specific climate change-related legislation and case law, and relevant multidisciplinary knowledge to build an understanding of the complex interactions that define climate change law. Topics that may be addressed include the multidisciplinary nature of climate law study, structures for climate change governance at the international and domestic levels, modes of climate change regulation, such as emissions trading schemes and renewable energy targets, litigation and its role in securing climate justice, and legal frameworks for climate change adaptation. Case studies considered throughout the intensive will provide students with an understanding of recent developments in the disciplinary area and the associated field of climate and energy law professional practice.</p>"
