        "<p>This subject will explore utopian architecture and planning projects based on political idealism, wishful thinking and the prospects of technology. What does technology contribute to the creation of a modern utopia? Is technology the key to a democratic society without poverty and class warfare? Is it a mechanism for the development of a totalitarian state? This subject will investigate the productive and critical dimensions of utopian thought, exploring the ways in which architecture performs as a vehicle for the implementation of political and social vision.</p>",
