    "overview": [
        "<p>Mechanical forces play a critical role in the healthy function of the human body, from movement during walking to beating of the heart. Mechanical forces also affect the properties and function of engineered tissues and influence the migration and spread of cancer cells through the body.  This subject introduces students to fundamental principles in mechanics including analysis of bioengineering systems under static equilibrium conditions, analysis of forces during dynamic motion, mechanical behaviour and strength of biomaterials. Topics covered in this subject will include: Newtons\u2019 laws of motion; stress and strain analysis in mechanical and biological systems subjected to different types of static loads; fundamentals of mechanical testing and failure analysis for biomaterials characterisation; fundamental physics underpinning motion of rigid bodies. Topics will draw on real-world bioengineering applications.    </p>",
