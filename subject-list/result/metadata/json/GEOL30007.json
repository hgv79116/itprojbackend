    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject explores the vast diversity of life that has inhabited planet Earth throughout its 4.5 billion year history and biology\u2019s dynamic role in shaping Earth\u2019s environments; from the inhospitable early Earth to the modern world we see around us. From the perspectives of energy flow, metabolism, species-species interactions, and evolutionary innovation, we explore the origin of life, photosynthesis and the oxygenation of the atmosphere, biogeochemical cycles, and life in extreme environments. Using paleontological principles we unravel the vast amount of information contained within fossils, including: paleoenvironmental reconstruction based on microfossil compositions; and broad evolutionary patterns of speciation and extinction spanning the appearance of the first biomineralized tissues half a billion years ago, to the rise and fall of dinosaurs and mammalian megafauna. The topics covered in this course also provide insight into a range of problems in the energy, minerals and environmental industry sectors.</p>"
