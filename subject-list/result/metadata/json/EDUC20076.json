        "<p>In this subject, students will explore visual communication and be introduced to Auslan, the language of the Australian signing Deaf community. In doing this, students will delve into the linguistic and cultural aspects of Auslan and develop skills in communicating using this visual language. As part of this subject, students will learn from signing Deaf adults and benefit from their lived experience and understanding of Auslan and communication. Students will gain an awareness of social and cultural diversity and an appreciation of social inclusion and the importance of access and equity. Students will be required to reflect on their individual experience learning a visual language.</p>"
