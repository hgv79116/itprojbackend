    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces Teacher Candidates to the field of arts education, with a focus on drama, music and the visual arts in primary education, and the role of digital and design technologies within the arts. Teacher Candidates will engage in theoretical and practical studies to become familiar with a range of knowledge, skills, processes and pedagogies for developing drama, music and visuals arts programs in the primary school. Teacher Candidates will explore digital and design technologies through the lens of design thinking and the arts, involving strategies for planning, analysing and generating designed solutions. They will examine the place of arts education and digital and design technologies in current policies including national and state curriculum developments, as well as national and international platforms such as UNESCO. Through reflection on their studio experiences, Teacher Candidates will understand the ways in which learning in the Arts and digital and design technologies supports cultural understanding, creativity and innovation, imaginative uses of technology, and communication through contemporary, traditional and emerging arts forms.</p>"
