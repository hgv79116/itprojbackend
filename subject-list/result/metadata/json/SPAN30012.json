        "<p>In this subject students co-create their own curriculum, following the \"choose your own adventure\" theme. In Latin America, cultural expression generally responds to specific socio-political contexts. This course explores different forms of resistance, mainly in popular music. Through the analysis of protest songs, it studies dissident social movements and artistic reactions to socio-political events. Each of the forms of expression selected for this course are explored within the socio-cultural space/time from which they emerge, telling stories of pain, loss and defeat but also the complexity and endurance of the resistance. Despite the racial, geographical, national, genre and ideological differences, all these cultural expressions share the constant search for identity and freedom.</p>"
