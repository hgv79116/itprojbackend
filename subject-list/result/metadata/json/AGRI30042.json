    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject outlines the methods used to identify pathogens causing plant diseases, the consequences of diseases for plant productivity, and control of plant diseases. The links between classic plant pathology and modern molecular pathology techniques are explored as plant breeders and pathologists seek novel integrated disease management procedures to control pathogens.</p>",
        "<p>Topics covered include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Taxonomy, identification and biology of the main groups of plant pathogens affecting Australian cropping industries and abiotic causes of plant diseases</li><li>Host pathogen relationships, and the nature of disease resistance and pathogenesis</li><li>Methods to identify pathogens, and development of tools for diagnosis</li><li>Modern bioinformatic techniques used in plant pathology</li><li>Processes leading to plant disease epidemics and their evaluation</li><li>Evolutionary processes and management practices affecting pathogen populations in agricultural ecosystems</li><li>Management and integrated control of plant diseases</li><li>Current professional opportunities and challenges in the field of plant pathology</li></ul>",
        "<p>Practical work includes:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Identification and diagnosis of common diseases</li><li>Development of skills in traditional and molecular research techniques and methodology in plant pathology</li><li>Development of bioinformatic skills used in pathogen diagnosis and molecular taxonomy of plant pathogens</li></ul>"
