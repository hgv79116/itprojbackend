    "overview": [
        "<p>Businesses operate in a competitive environment. Although some business may not have competitors when they are first established, if they are successful competitors will come. Hence, it is necessary for a business to understand how it can achieve success and sustain that success in the competitive arena. This course is designed to provide the tools, concepts, and frameworks to both formulate and to execute a sustainable competitive advantage. The focus is not how to be better than your competitors but rather how to be unique or different than your competitors. This perspective allows for multiple \u201cwinners\u201d in an industry each targeting a different set of customers as opposed to direct, head-to-head competition that is usually destructive to both competitors.</p>"
