    "overview": [
        "<p>The subject comprises a series of advanced lectures, delivered in research seminar format with accompanying readings and learning activities, each focussing on a key area of physiotherapy research methodology in the context of a specific clinical field and practice context. Students will develop an understanding of a broad range of research methodologies that can be applied to address physiotherapy research questions across a range of areas such as acute cardiorespiratory rehabilitation, exercise oncology, neurological rehabilitation, musculoskeletal, and sports and exercise, and paediatrics.</p>",
        "<p>Students will also attend workshops, journal clubs and postgraduate research presentations or research meetings relevant to their specific topic.</p>"
