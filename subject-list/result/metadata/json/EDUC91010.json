    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides opportunities for Teacher Candidates to begin to demonstrate the nexus between theory and the practice of teaching, drawing on a range of theoretical perspectives and contemporary research to support their teaching practice. During clinical teaching practice, experienced Mentor Teachers will continue to support Teacher Candidates in collaboration with university-based academics who are also engaged in the on-campus teaching program.</p>",
        "<p>This subject requires Teacher Candidates to demonstrate their developing professional knowledge, clinical practice, and professional engagement in the secondary school context. The school placement focuses on developing an understanding of student characteristics, principles of learning and teaching, classroom management and school organisation in typical secondary school settings. Candidates begin to analyse teaching and learning to identify lesson formats that make productive classrooms and pedagogies, and are effective for individual students. Teacher Candidates will integrate the content of academic subjects taught during the semester with their teaching practice in an intentional manner in order to demonstrate developing understanding of students\u2019 progression along learning and development trajectories. Teacher Candidates take graduated responsibility for the planning, implementation and assessment of lessons based on national and state curricula. Teacher Candidates will differentiate their teaching to include students with diverse needs and backgrounds and consider Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives on learning and development.</p>",
        "<p>The Clinical Teaching Practice seminars are framed by the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers at the Graduate Level. At seminars, Teacher Candidates will engage in collaborative learning and critical reflection.</p>",
        "<p>Note: Teacher Candidates who are not familiar with contemporary Australian school contexts are advised to undertake a program of workshops available as an alternate pathway for this subject and known as \u2018Contemporary Australian Schooling\u2019. These workshops will parallel Candidates\u2019 introduction to the Australian classroom environment and the Victorian Curriculum. Teacher Candidates will develop knowledge of typical school structures, policies and procedures as well as skills for personal professional interaction between students, mentors and peers. Teacher Candidates undertaking this program will be expected to attend their school placement on all scheduled days and attend all professional practice seminars. There is a reduced requirement for independent, whole class teaching for the duration of the workshop program.</p>"
