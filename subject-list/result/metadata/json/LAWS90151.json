        "<p>Contemporary governments use contracts as a key tool of governance. Outsourcing of public services is commonplace. But should we regulate the use of such tools by means of public administrative law, or through private law, or a mixture of both?  Is there an accountability deficit? What are the advantages and risks of contracting out, and how can and should the law respond?</p>",
        "<p>Professor Janet McLean brings both public law and private law perspectives to bear on the subject of public contracting drawing on Australian, New Zealand and United Kingdom examples.</p>",

        "<ul><li>The distinctive normative bases of private and private law and their implications for government contracts</li><li>The decision to outsource</li><li>The reach of judicial review, freedom of information and human rights law, and financial reporting rules, into the realm of contract law</li><li>Implied terms, procedural requirements and interpretative methods in contract law</li><li>Procurement rules and other internal government guidance</li><li>Public private financing initiatives and other examples of government contracting</li><li>The auditor-general and the role of private auditors.</li></ul>"
