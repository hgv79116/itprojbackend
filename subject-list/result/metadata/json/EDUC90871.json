    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject comprises the compulsory [AQF] Capstone experience for this course. Drawing on theory, knowledge and skills developed throughout the Master of International Education (International Baccalaureate), students will complete an independent research project.  In this subject, students access data from a prior research project about teaching and learning strategies in IB classrooms.  Students undertake a critical analysis of the original project and then design their own research using the original data. The project undertaken through this subject is designed to assist students to explore, measure and evaluate the International Baccalaureate in a classroom context. Students will further be required to think critically and explore the theoretical implications surrounding teaching and learning in globalised programs.</p>"
