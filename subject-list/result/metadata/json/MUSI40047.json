        "<p>Through individual studies of selected musical centres and repertories, students will explore the nature, the role, and the functions of music in European society during the Renaissance. Using diverse materials, students will engage in a directed exploration of selected repertory, manuscript and printed sources, early notation, theoretical writings, performance practices, social history and current issues in scholarship and performance. Students will gain an enhanced experience of the musical life of the period, and develop critical skills that will assist them to evaluate recent musicological scholarship and modern performances.</p>"
