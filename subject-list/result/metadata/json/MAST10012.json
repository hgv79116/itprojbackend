    "overview": [
        "<p>Students will strengthen and develop algebraic and conceptual skills, building a firm mathematical base for MAST10005 Calculus 1. <br/>Fundamental concepts about number systems and set theory will be followed by introductory counting principles and techniques. These will be applied to the laws of probability, leading to the study of discrete and continuous random variables. Basic ideas about functions and their inverses will be introduced using examples such as the logarithmic, exponential and trigonometric functions. Differential and integral calculus will be studied with applications to graph sketching and optimization problems. Students will also learn integration techniques, with applications to areas between curves.</p>"
