Areas covered will include text analysis including the revelation of its interior world through action and improvisation, methodologies of actor practice including vocal and movement work, tools of character and context analysis and performance techniques that support the physical and emotional fluency of the actor.</p>",
        "<p>Students will learn to work spontaneously and to use this spontaneity in the theatrical context as both solo performers and in group tasks. The interface between acting skills and their use within other art forms will be explored and students will develop skills in giving and receiving critical feedback.</p>"
