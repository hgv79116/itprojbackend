        "<p>In PATH30004 Advanced Investigation of Human Disease students will extend their understanding of human disease in the context of library or laboratory based research projects. This subject will give students the opportunity to work within a research group investigating diseases of significance to society and provide them with an appreciation of the relationship between basic research and the investigation of complex diseases and how research discoveries can contribute to the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of disease.</p>",
        "<p>This subject is an elective subject for Science and Biomedicine students intending to take a major in Pathology and is recommended for students interested in doing Honours in Pathology.</p>"
