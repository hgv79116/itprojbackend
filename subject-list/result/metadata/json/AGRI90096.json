        "<p>New sensing methodologies available for monitoring physiological crop traits related to crop photosynthesis and transpiration via fluorescence emission detection will be described, linking to new tools required by industry in the context of high\u2011throughput data collection for plant phenotyping and plant breeding. Students will gain practical experience with laboratory and field physiological measurement techniques, remote sensing, precision agriculture tools and data analytical methods.</p>"
