    "overview": [
        "<p>Dredging is an excavation activity carried out underwater for keeping waterways navigable, beach nourishment and land reclamation. The subject examines Dredging Engineering Fundamentals such as dredging techniques, disposal of dredge material, basic dredge laws, sediment re-suspension and environment aspects. It provides a multi-disciplinary overview of problems by combining cutting-edge research in Maritime and Coastal Engineering and strong engagement of eminent industry-based lecturers from major Australian Port Authorities. A number of industry-based applications and case-study examples will be introduced to complement the lectures. The subject will provide students with a solid grounding in the technologies, concepts, methods &amp; hydrodynamic theories used in the planning, design &amp; execution of dredging projects.</p>",
        "<p>Topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Types and selection of dredgers;</li><li>Fluid mechanics of dredging;</li><li>Geotechnical issues;</li><li>Survey control;</li><li>Maintenance dredging;</li><li>Coastal and river morphology and sediment transport;</li><li>Environmental studies;</li><li>Hydrodynamic modelling;</li><li>Dredging contracts.</li></ul>"
