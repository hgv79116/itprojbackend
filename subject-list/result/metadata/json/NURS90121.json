    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is designed to promote development of foundation theoretical knowledge and scientific advances in treatment modalities available for the care management for persons affected by cancer. Key concepts explored in this subject relate to understanding the pathophysiology of cancer and carcinogenesis, the principles of cure, control, and symptom management. Surgery, chemotherapy and radiation will be described as core treatments and elements of a multi-modal approach. The physical and psychosocial impacts of diagnosis and treatment on people with cancer and their family are explored, as are opportunities to develop knowledge and skills to enhance the experience of survivors. Essential skills to support people affected by a life-threatening illness, as well as essential ethico-legal aspects of care will be explored. Emphasis is placed on health assessment; implementing and evaluating patient-centred care through the delivery of evidence-based nursing interventions across the disease trajectory. Throughout the subject knowledge and skills in therapeutic communication are embedded. Interventions initiated by nurses at a beginning level of specialty practice will be described in terms of evidence available to underpin practice and the pre-requisite technical knowledge to support skill development.</p>"
