    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides opportunities for Teacher Candidates to demonstrate the nexus between the theory and practice of teaching when teaching children aged from birth to 35 months, drawing on a range of theoretical perspectives and contemporary research to support their teaching practice. This subject requires teacher candidates to demonstrate their developing professional knowledge, clinical practice, and professional engagement. Teacher Candidates will integrate the content of academic subjects taught during the semester with their teaching practice in an intentional manner, in order to demonstrate developing understanding of children\u2019s progression along learning and development trajectories. During clinical teaching practice, experienced Mentor Teachers support Teacher Candidates in collaboration with academics who have relevant areas of expertise.</p>",
        "<p>Guided by the National Quality Framework, Teacher Candidates undertake graduated responsibility for the planning, implementation and assessment of learning experiences. Teacher Candidates will differentiate their teaching to include children with diverse needs and backgrounds and consider Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives on learning and development.</p>",
        "<p>The Clinical Teaching Practice seminars are framed by the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers at the Graduate Level. At seminars, Teacher Candidates will engage in collaborative learning and critical reflection.</p>"
