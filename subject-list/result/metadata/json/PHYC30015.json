        "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The two subjects PHYC30014 Laboratory Work A and PHYC30015 Laboratory Work B are offered sequentially. In both subjects laboratory work draws from a common pool of experiments. Practical experience is available in the following laboratories: nuclear physics, particle physics, diffraction, electronics, atomic physics, optical physics and astronomy. Mechanical workshop experience is also available. In some laboratories individual projects can be selected. PHYC30015 Laboratory Work B offers the possible extension to research project work.</p>",
