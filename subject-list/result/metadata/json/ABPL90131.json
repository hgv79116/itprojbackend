    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces students to the theories, skills and tools used in strategic planning, from problem identification and site analysis; through demographic, economic, and social background research, including GIS; identification of alternatives and policy development; to creating an implementation, monitoring and evaluation plan. <br/>There is a strong international comparative emphasis to this subject, including a focus on 'the real world' of governance in relation to ongoing debates about inclusive, socially just and environmentally sustainable cities.<br/><br/>This subject involves a site visit (field trip) which will run in place of the lecture and tutorial in week three. The site visit is an assessment hurdle requirement and students will be required to cover the local public transport costs.</p>"
