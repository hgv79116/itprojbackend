    "overview": [
        "<p>Korean 6 is suitable for students who have successfully completed Korean 5 or who possess an equivalent level of Korean language proficiency. This subject prepares students to engage in formal settings in Korean. It trains students to communicate on a wide range of topics in history, society and technology. Students will refine their communication skills on discipline-specific vocabulary and functionality. Students will also broaden the grammatical understanding and applications of Hanja, Sino-Korean idioms and technical terminology for academic performance. Through class activities, students will employ various forms of multimedia and field-specific texts to grasp the specialisation of language function and practical translation. In addition, students will develop interpersonal skills and cultural awareness to understand others and to present themselves appropriately in cross-cultural situations.</p>"
