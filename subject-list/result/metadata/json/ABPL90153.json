    "overview": [
        "<p>The subject teaches how to use two modelling approaches to investigate and communicate complex and innovative environmental solutions for energy efficient building design. Led by experienced software users from industry and from software manufactures, this course will allow students to specialise in a software tool which they may already be using at their work.</p>",
        "<p>Based on a case study approach students will assess an existing or new building project and prepare the documentation arguing for the innovative approaches to energy efficiency that are proposed. Focus will not only be on learning how to model these complex scenarios, but also how to interpret their practicality and develop risk profiles allowing end users to be able to choose between innovation and benefit.<br/><br/><strong>Prescribed</strong> <strong>software programs with no cost</strong><br/>IES Virtual Environment<br/><br/>Details of software availability and pricing are captured at: <a href=\"https://msd.unimelb.edu.au/current-students/student-experience/it-support\">https://msd.unimelb.edu.au/current-students/student-experience/it-support</a><br/><br/><br/></p>",
