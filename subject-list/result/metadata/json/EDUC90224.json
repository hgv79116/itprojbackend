    "overview": [
        "<p>Counselling skills are taught within a framework that reflects a person-centred model of counselling, focussing in particular on three aspects: the knowledge and skills involved in establishing an effective therapeutic relationship, the skills of assessment and goal setting, and the skill in the selection and use of action strategies. The skills of attending, minimal encouragers, open questioning, reflective listening, empathy, immediacy, challenging and summarising are covered. Participants are introduced to intervention strategies applicable once the therapeutic relationship has been established. Values and ethics are examined and students are invited to review the influence of their own values in their counselling practice. Cross-cultural issues, developmental stages and specific circumstances are considered. The mode of instruction is largely experiential, using video feedback, small and large group demonstrations, and student participation. Students are introduced to cases from the educational field, and contribute material from their own experience as appropriate. The program draws upon established psychological theory and practice supported by extensive literature. The unit lays the foundation for much of the work of the practising psychologist.</p>"
