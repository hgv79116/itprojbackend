        "<p>This subject provides students with an insight into how medical problems are approached in the 21st century. Students spend 5-6 hours addressing each of six \u201cmaladies\u201d, selected to demonstrate the holistic nature of medical practice and the integration of biomedical research into the development of novel diagnostics and evidence-based therapies.</p>",
        "<p>Each module includes elements of normal anatomy and physiology, the epidemiology and the pathology of disease, including any genetic, microbiological, immunological, and inflammatory processes that underpin the pathology. Finally, the public health implications of the malady are considered wherever possible.</p>"
