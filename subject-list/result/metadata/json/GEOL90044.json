        "<p>This course provides an introduction to the key features of several major classes of economically important mineral deposits. Each deposit style will be discussed in terms of geological and tectonic framework, mineralisation, alteration, genetic models and exploration criteria. Lectures covering each deposit type will be complemented with exercises or practical classes which examine sample sets of typical ores and host rocks.</p>"
