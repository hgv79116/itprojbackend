    "overview": [
        "<p>While ethnography as method is the most distinguishing feature of anthropology, ethnographic practice has always taken place in continual conversation with theory. Just as theoretical and philosophical considerations sometimes guide and generate particular ethnographic orientations and issues, sometimes ethnographic practices generate theoretical developments that have had repercussions well beyond anthropology. This subject explores various important moments in the ethnographic generation of theory that has occurred throughout the history of anthropology. It examines in some details the ethnographic texts where the theories were first developed.<br/><br/></p>"
