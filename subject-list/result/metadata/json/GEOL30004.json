    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will examine the role that geochemistry plays in Earth processes\u2013including those associated with the formation and evolution of our planet. It will explore the many ways in which the geochemical data preserved in rocks and minerals can provide quantitative and qualitative insights into these Earth-forming processes, including the timing of key events in our planet\u2019s history. Many of the approaches investigated in this subject can also be applied to a wide range of topics such as palaeoclimate reconstruction, resource exploration and archaeological science. The subject emphasises the application of geochemical methods to unfamiliar problems, simulating the experience of a working geoscientist, and is applicable to broader range of scientific careers.</p>"
