    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is an in-depth examination of property investment and financing strategy and decision-making, with a focus on cash flows, return, and value. Property investments are surveyed with emphases on the analysis of commercial real estate and the theory and methods of investment analysis in respect to tax and financial consequences. Financial and non-financial determinants of investment feasibility of income-producing property are covered. The subject covers a range of approaches used in financing of investment properties. A case-based approach facilitates student learnings in analysing investment and financing strategies as they are applied to real world scenarios. Students will learn financial modelling skills, the art of investment and financing decision making involving qualitative and quantitative skills, and considerations that add value to property assets and investment portfolios of investors</p>",
