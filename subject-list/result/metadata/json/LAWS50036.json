        "<p>This subject studies the nature, goals and structure of private law remedies, and is organised around the remedial goals of compensation, perfection, vindication, disgorgement, restitution and punishment. The subject explores how and why these different remedial goals are accorded differing priority and/or are given effect in different ways across different areas of private law, specifically torts, contract and equity, thereby deepening the student's understanding of remedies and also the nature of each of these substantive fields of private law.</p>",
        "<p>Topics to be covered in the subject will include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Compensation (compensatory (including aggravated) damages for breach of contract, tort and in equity);</li><li>Perfection (debt, specific performance and injunctions);</li><li>Vindication (damages in substitution of rights and vindicatory damages);</li><li>Disgorgement and accounting for profits;</li><li>Restitution (the measure of restitution; rescission; unjust enrichment);</li><li>Punishment in private law (exemplary damages); and</li><li>Statutory remedies.</li></ul>",
