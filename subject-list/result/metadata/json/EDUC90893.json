        "<p>This subject provides further opportunities for Teacher Candidates to consolidate their understanding of the nexus between theory and practice of teaching, drawing on a range of theoretical perspectives and contemporary research whilst teaching children aged three to five years.</p>",
        "<p>This subject requires Teacher Candidates to demonstrate their developing professional knowledge, clinical practice, and professional engagement. Guided by the National Quality Framework, Teacher Candidates will extend their ability to closely observe children\u2019s learning and development, taking increasing responsibility for the planning, implementation and evaluation of learning experiences, demonstrating their developing understanding of children\u2019s progression along learning and development trajectories. Teacher Candidates will continue to differentiate their teaching to include students with diverse needs and backgrounds and will take into account Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives on learning and development. Experienced Mentor Teachers will continue to support Teacher Candidates in collaboration with academics who have relevant areas of expertise.</p>",
        "<p>The Clinical Teaching Practice seminars are framed by the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers at the Graduate Level. At seminars, Teacher Candidates will engage in collaborative learning and critical reflection.</p>",
