    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject examines the politics of peace and war between the \u2018great powers\u2019 of the contemporary world. It begins with the realist claim that war is basic to international relations and the attendant argument that peace is merely the period of preparation between two wars. This claim is then examined and critically evaluated through a range of literatures \u2013 historical and theoretical \u2013 and in-depth case studies of great power politics and rivalry from World War One to today.</p>",
        "<p>The analysis will be informed by a consideration of the nature of the international system \u2013 why and when it incentivises conflict \u2013 and the internal character of the great powers themselves so as to understand better when and why they choose to fight. Does the quest for security by great powers render other states less secure? Can international law obviate the recurrence of war? Why, despite the evolution of complex international governance mechanisms, do liberal democracies still rely on military force to realise their objectives? Can hegemony be transferred from one state or group of states to another peacefully? Does the nature of autocracy in states such as China and Russia make war with non-autocratic states inevitable? Will rising powers \u2013 like China, Brazil and India \u2013 become more or less pacific? These questions and many others form our substantial focus.</p>"
