    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject examines the history of Indigenous peoples\u2019 resistance to colonialism in Australia, the Pacific and the Americas. In addition to covering the key protests of the last one hundred years, we see activism as more than just a twentieth-century phenomenon and explore the diverse forms that it took across the last three centuries. What is activism? What is resistance? And how big or small do actions have to be to enter the historical record? From political protest to music, sport, art, environmental activism, imperial literacy, feminism, space, land, mobility, sovereignty, refusal and silence, this subject will broaden students\u2019 understanding of the history of the many ways Indigenous peoples have negotiated with and shaped the \u2018post\u2019colonial world.</p>"
