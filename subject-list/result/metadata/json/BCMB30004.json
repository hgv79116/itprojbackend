        "<p>Aberrations in the structure and expression of hormones, growth factors, neurotransmitters and their receptors can give rise to diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. To understand the molecular basis of these diseases, it is essential to know how hormones, growth factors and neurotransmitters are synthesised, and how their signals are recognised, amplified and transmitted by intracellular signalling pathways in the target cells.</p>",
        "<p>Topics covered, to illustrate the importance of signalling in health and disease, include  the structures of the major classes of signalling receptors, the mechanisms of intercellular and intracellular signal transduction, second messengers, examples of post-translational modifications such as protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation, ubiquitination and S-nitrosylation and their impact on signalling, mechanisms of cell death and autophagy, and innate immune signalling.</p>"
