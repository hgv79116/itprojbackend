    "overview": [
        "<p>Studio Japan will examine the unique island landscape between land and sea to interrogate the role of architecture and landscape in community revitalization, ecological regeneration, and creative place-making. Students will examine the Japanese countryside as a source of inspiration and potential while responding to pressing contemporary social and ecological challenges. Japan, as one of the first countries to transition into a post-growth society, needs alternative design approaches that acknowledge and work within the limits of growth. We are interested in human-scale design that draws on local and available resources, knowledge and materials with possible areas for further investigation including adaptive design, reuse and repair, circular ecologies and economies, community-led architecture, non-human/multi-species design, materiality and indigenous knowledge systems, and other creative, engaged and critical ways to confront our current ecological and social conditions.</p>",
        "<p>After time in Tokyo, we will travel to the islands in Kamijima Town in Ehime Prefecture. Kamijima is a group of small islands facing shrinkage and depopulation where young people have moved to larger cities leaving behind an increasing number of vacant houses, abandoned farmland and empty shops. At the same time, the islands are experiencing a rise in tourism and are committed to building new facilities including a \u2018Michi no Eki\u2019, a multi-use facility to showcase local produce and become a hub for both tourists and residents. We will work together with Kamijima Town staff and the local community to propose ideas for a Michi no Eki as well as additional programmes based on student\u2019s own research and inquiry. Wider opportunities for revitalisation will be explored including the regenerative potentials of slow ecology, cultural tourism and possibilities for nature-driven retreat.</p>",

        "<p>Travel dates to Japan: January 7 \u2013 21.</p>",
        "<p>Approx cost will be around $3500, not including airfare. It will vary based on what accommodation each student chooses.</p>",
