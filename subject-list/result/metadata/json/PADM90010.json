        "<p>The Applied Syndicate Project is a capstone option in the Melbourne Master of Public Administration. The Melbourne MPA is an interdisciplinary, globally-focused program for managers that work within or with government. This subject enables participants to draw on the expertise developed throughout the MPA and apply it in real time to a contemporary project. The project is team-based to mirror the practical experience of managers and will be developed and overseen by both a professional and academic mentor. The syndicate group will work in consultation with their practice and academic mentors to develop a project brief, undertake analysis, and prepare a professional report to the sponsoring organisation. The syndicate will present their report at the Capstone Presentation Day.</p>"
