    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will discuss the role of synthetic and organic fertilisers in maintaining soil fertility for sustainable agricultural production systems. The subject will explore the concepts of soil fertility and nutrient management from the standpoint of chemical, physical and biological processes in soil. Key nutrient cycles in soil will be discussed with a view to understanding plant requirements across a range of agricultural crops, where and why inefficiencies occur in delivery of nutrients to the plant and management strategies that can be used to maximise nutrient use efficiency and minimise  environmental impacts of fertiliser application. The role of soil amendments in maintaining soil health will also be explored. Students will be encouraged to critically evaluate the role of conventional and alternative fertilisers for maintaining soil fertility and critically review methods used for assessing different nutrient management approaches. The principles involved in soil and plant sampling and analysis, and commercial laboratory methodologies, will be explored in laboratory and field settings. Students will gain skills in interpretation of laboratory data to provide meaningful fertiliser recommendations to growers</p>"
