        "<p>Venice Studio is a 2-week design studio program held in Venice, Italy each July, between semesters one and two, during the European summer. The program partners with leading international offices of architecture, landscape architecture and urbanism to introduce students to the complexities of the historic city of Venice, its lagoon and surrounding landscape in the contemporary age of cultural tourism.<br/><br/>Students consider the acute convergence of heritage, environment, mass tourism, aesthetics, design culture and professional practice to develop design projects which re-evaluate the difficult adjacency of historical buildings, sensitive ecosystems and contemporary design techniques. Immersion within the city and living its day-to-day rhythms provides students with the tools for generating a design project for a site or sites in or around Venice.</p>",
        "<p><br/>International offices of architecture and urbanism lead each studio, design the brief, select the site and direct the development of student projects throughout the duration of the program in dedicated studio spaces in Venice. Additional invited guests provide lectures and hold discussions with students. Fieldtrips to locations within Venice, the surrounding islands and the broader Veneto region play an important role within the program. More information can be found at: <a href=\"http://www.venice.studio\">www.venice.studio</a></p>",
        "<p> </p>",
        "<p><strong>Note:</strong> Enrolment in Venice Studio requires students to travel to Venice, Italy. Classes will be held in Venice for the duration of the teaching period (first 2 weeks of the programme). Students are responsible for organising their international flights, accommodation, visa to enter Italy (if required).The subject coordinator can, if necessary, provide additional information about Venice, inc. where to stay etc.</p>",
