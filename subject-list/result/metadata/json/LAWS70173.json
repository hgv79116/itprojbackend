    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is an introduction to the foundational principles and rules of the public international legal order. It is designed as an introduction to international law and, therefore, provides students with an understanding of the key concepts of international law, its history and contemporary relevance, sources of international law and the role of some key international institutions, such as the United Nations (UN). The subject is grounded in both theory and practice in order to consider how international law works in shaping and dealing with a range of issues such as dispute settlement, jurisdiction and immunities, and the use of force. Contemporary examples will be used to enrich student learning. Students will be encouraged to critically evaluate the position and relevance of international law in international politics and society by addressing past and current developments through case studies. The members of the teaching team are scholars in international law who have developed specific areas of specialisation in international law.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>The nature, purpose and language of international law</li><li>Sources of international law</li><li>International legal personality, statehood and sovereignty</li><li>Jurisdiction of states and jurisdictional immunities</li><li>The responsibility of states for violations of international law</li><li>Peaceful settlement of disputes and the functions of the International Court of Justice</li><li>Regulation of the use of force in international relations (jus ad bellum)</li></ul>"

While every effort will be made to meet the needs of students trained in other fields, concessions will not be made in the general level of instruction or assessment. Most subjects assume the knowledge usually acquired in a degree in law (LLB, JD or equivalent).
