    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will show how to assess sedimentary basins for their resource potential, particularly those resources dependent upon porosity and permeability, such as geothermal energy, water, hydrocarbons and gas/CO2-storage. The skills taught come primarily from the petroleum industry, including seismic interpretation, borehole analysis, core-logging and temperature measurement, but are applied to assess all resources. Students will assess the ESE (economic, social and environmental) value of the resources. Students will each present and promote a farm-out investment opportunity and will be given an investment portfolio. Each student will be required to rank the opportunities against their portfolio. Practically, this will be achieved by comparing and contrasting eastern Australia basins of different types; the Palaeozoic Drummond Basin in Queensland, and the Mesozoic-Tertiary Gippsland-Otway Basins in Victoria. The key assignment will be to analyse the origin, fill, sediment properties and tectonic history of each basin and to assess its resource potential. The subject will include a one-day field excursion to Peninsula Hot Springs geothermal bathing and spa resort on the Mornington Peninsula. </p>"
