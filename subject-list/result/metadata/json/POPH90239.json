    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is an elective subject within the Master of Public Health. It is designed to be taken by students who want to consolidate their public health training via an advanced professional work placement. Entry to the subject will be competitive and a quota will apply.<br/>Students will undertake a supervised professional work placement with an appropriate organisation. Each practicum experience will be individually tailored and negotiated by the student, the host organisation, and the Professional Practice Coordinator. Students will learn to apply their academic knowledge to real-world public health challenges, developing their specialist and professional skill set by contributing to the needs of an agency, institution or community organisation concerned with population health. The practicum experience will enable students to bridge the gap between the classroom and public health practice, whilst developing contacts with experts in their chosen field.</p>"
