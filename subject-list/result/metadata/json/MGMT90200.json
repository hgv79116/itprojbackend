    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject examines advanced themes and issues in the theory and practice of strategic management. Embedded in the critical examination of competitive advantage as derived from sources internal and external to the firm, this subject is designed to provide students with an appreciation of strategic management as a value-added approach to conceptualising the firm and its environment in pursuit of optimum rewards. Drawing on rich and varied theoretical traditions, contemporary research and case study analysis, students will progress through a variety of process, content and contextual considerations to secure an advanced perspective of the strategic management discipline. Broad topics include strategic change, strategy formation and implementation; business, corporate and network level strategies and examination of industry, organisational and international contexts. Within these broader topics such issues as innovation and dynamic capability theory will be investigated.</p>"
