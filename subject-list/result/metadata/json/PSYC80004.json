        "<p>Students will acquire the capacity to carry out independent research, and will demonstrate the ability to make an original contribution to knowledge in the discipline of psychology. The major difference between the Masters by Research and the PhD is that the former is more limited in scope.</p>",
        "<p>Psychological Sciences hosts a number of well-equipped laboratories in which research is carried out by teams of staff members, often in collaboration with researchers from other University departments as well as affiliated institutions. Many of these laboratories have been successful in obtaining grants from the Australian Research Council (ARC), the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and other external granting bodies. These laboratories are very keen to accept postgraduate students to participate in their research programs.</p>"
