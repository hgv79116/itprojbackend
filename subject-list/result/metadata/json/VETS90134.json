    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject continues the integrated and inter-disciplinary approach to the study of organ function and dysfunction in animals that was introduced in year one of the DVM course. Building on students\u2019 prior knowledge of body system function and dysfunction and their experience of scientific and clinical reasoning, this subject introduces students to the structure and normal functioning of the nervous, ocular and auditory systems, and to the principles of dysfunction of these systems. Students learn about pharmacology and therapeutics as they relate to this system. Using case-based teaching approaches, they will apply their understanding of organ and system function and dysfunction to authentic situations that enhance the development of integrative clinical reasoning abilities, and to analysis of cases that involve multiple organ perturbation.</p>"
