        "<p>This subject will explore the fundamentals of quantum programming and quantum algorithm design. The subject will introduce students to a range of different quantum programming platforms and languages, and will include hands-on modules. The students will be prepared to write quantum programs, implement a range of simple quantum algorithms, such as Grover\u2019s and Shor\u2019s algorithms, and to execute quantum programs on a quantum computer through a cloud access.</p>",
        "<p>This subject will be made up of three parts:</p>",
        "<ol><li>Fundamentals of quantum computing and quantum programming, including running quantum programs on actual cloud-based quantum computers.</li><li>Programming fundamental quantum algorithms, such as the Deutsch\u2013Jozsa, Grover, Shor and HHL algorithms.</li><li>Quantum programming for cutting edge research topics, such as quantum error correction, variational quantum circuits and quantum machine learning.</li></ol>"
