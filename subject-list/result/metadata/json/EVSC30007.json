        "<p>This subject takes students through a process of identifying, planning, managing, analysing and reporting on a project relating to a problem or issue in either urban or forested ecosystem. Selection of the problem or issue is led by students and is structured to explore ecological, environmental, social, spatial, temporal and economic related topics.</p>",
        "<p>Activities include developing a project proposal and objectives, project planning and timelines, scientific methods of analysis, evaluation and synthesis of data and/or information and the preparation and presentation of results, findings or outcomes. Students will also work in groups drawing upon their prior degree studies to develop recommendations, provide solutions, or outline further insights for their problem or issue.</p>",
        "<p>In collaboration with industry representatives and academic staff, this subject enables students to explore projects based on real world problems through a work integrated learning and relevant capstone experience.</p>"
