    "overview": [
        "<p>More than 90 new constitutions have been made for countries across all regions of the world since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Currently, constitution-making is actively underway in a range of states and pending in others. This concentrated burst of activity has given rise to a range of new ideas about the nature and purpose of constitutions, constitutional solutions to contemporary problems, the processes of constitution-making and the proper role of international actors. This subject explores these issues, with particular reference to a series of topical case studies, including Fiji, Iraq, Kenya, Nepal, Timor-Leste and Yemen. The lecturers are constitutional scholars with practical experience in the field who add to the excitement and relevance of the subject</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Nature, functions and limitations of constitutions</li><li>Circumstances in which constitutions are likely to be renewed or substantially changed</li><li>Influences on new constitutions</li><li>Substance of constitutions</li><li>Phases of constitution-making:<ul><li>Peace process (if any)</li><li>Setting the agenda</li><li>Design and writing</li><li>Approval and adoption</li><li>Implementation</li><li>Interpretation</li><li>Selected case studies drawn from Egypt, Fiji, Indonesia, Iraq, Kenya, Pakistan, the Philippines, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Swaziland, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Tunisia, Yemen and Zimbabwe among others.</li></ul></li></ul>",
