    "overview": [
        "<p><span>Framed by the philosophy and practice of two-way/both way learning,</span> this subject will examine a range of cultural objects, with various deterioration and preservation issues. Using participant-led discussion and teacher-led investigation, students will provide input from their particular cultural perspective as to possible best practice and effective treatment options for the longer term conservation of the object. Students will also learn to contextualise particular examples within broader knowledge-sharing principles that are central to cross-cultural conservation practices. Basic conservation treatment decision-making will be examined and this will require students to consider the complexity of intervention and the impact of cross-cultural decision making where senior knowledge may be cultural, academic or professional. Students will then undertake basic treatment of an object.</p>"
