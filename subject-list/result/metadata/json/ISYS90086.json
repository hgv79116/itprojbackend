        "<p><strong>AIMS</strong></p>",
        "<p>Data warehouses are designed to provide organisations with an integrated set of high quality data to support decision-makers. They should support flexible and multi-dimensional retrieval and analysis of data. Topics covered include data warehousing and decision-making, data warehouse design, data warehouse implementation, data sourcing and data quality, on-line analytical processing (OLAP) and data mining, customer relationship management systems, and case studies of data warehousing practice. This subject is part of the Business Analytics stream within the Master of Information Systems.</p>",
        "<p>Students who have a weighted average mark of at least 75% in the Master of Information Systems have the option to complete the on-line Advanced Elective ISYS90094 Business Analysis and Decision Making instead of ISYS90086 Data Warehousing.</p>",
        "<p><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT<br/></strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject introduces the compelling need for data warehousing, data warehouse architectures, decision making, data warehouse design, data warehouse modelling, data quality, data warehouse implementation - including the Extract Transform Load (ETL) process, and data warehouse use in supporting decision making \u2013 including decision making tools and OLAP. Readings are provided for all topics that introduce real world cases on data warehousing and related areas and include the use of data warehousing for competitive advantage, success and failure stories in Data Warehousing.</p>"
