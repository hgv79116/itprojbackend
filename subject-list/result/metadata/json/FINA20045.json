    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will introduce students to the unique possibilities inherent in printmaking techniques, with a technical focus on screenprinting processes. As well as focusing on the development and application of screenprinting skills and techniques, students will be introduced to historical and contemporary contexts for screenprinting practice.<br/><br/>Within the workshop, students will be encouraged to explore their own work and utilise a selection of techniques by engaging with ideas of repetition, difference, and variation. This subject is designed to explore fundamental screenprinting processes as a vehicle for imaging ideas and for image production, as well as to motivate and involve students in analytical thinking about visual perception. It also includes an induction into the Screenprinting workshop, with an emphasis on Occupational Health &amp; Safety.<br/><br/>Though this subject is designed for students who have little or no previous screenprinting experience, it will also suit students who have previously undertaken a visual art Breadth subject or similar.</p>"
