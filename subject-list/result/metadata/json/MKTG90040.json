        "<p>Sales are the only sustainable source of revenues for any firm. Despite the importance and significance of sales, the understanding of sales, the different salesperson roles (facilitator, persuader, orchestrator, etc.), and the different selling situations that might arise are often poorly understood. In this subject we discuss these issues alongside aspects such as the potential for sales to contribute to the creation of customer value, the importance and approaches to pricing, and we introduce the concept of selling value. A specific aspect of this course involves the drafting of sales plans and pitches.</p>"
