    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is designed to provide students with a broad understanding of some of the current legal, regulatory and ethical issues that arise in relation to promoting and protecting human health at an individual and population level. The subject aims to give students a sense of the breadth of the field that is \u2018health law\u2019 and to introduce them to some of the different ethical approaches commonly applied in this area, including utilitarianism, human   rights, ethics of care, principle-based ethics and Kantian ethics. The subject will address the initial question of what it means to be \u2018healthy\u2019 and the appropriate role for law and regulation in in securing \u2018good health\u2019 before examining selected health law issues using an ethical framework.</p>",
        "<p>At the individual level, students will have an opportunity to examine a range of current health dilemmas that arise from pre-birth to end of life decisions. Recent developments in reproductive medicine raise important ethical and legal questions about the status of the embryo, the welfare of the child to be born and the role of the state in regulating reproductive choice. Controversial topics include abortion, access to assisted reproductive treatment, selective reproduction, surrogacy and donor conception. Throughout a human lifetime, a myriad of health care decisions arise for an individual. Some of these can be challenging, particularly when the individual has diminished capacity or mental health issues. The subject will outline the doctrine of informed consent before giving students an opportunity to explore decision-making in complex cases.</p>",
        "<p>The subject also introduces students to the notion of population health and some of the types of measures that are taken outside of health care settings in order to ensure the society\u2019s health. Attention will be given to domestic and international legal mechanisms for responding to a range of communicable diseases (for example, Ebola and Zika viruses) and non-communicable diseases, such as those related to lifestyle factors (for example, tobacco use). The subject will also examine the domestic and international legal mechanisms available for ensuring that a society has a functioning health care system. In this context, students will study the role that international and domestic human rights law, in particular the right to health, play in securing access to quality health care goods and services.</p>"
