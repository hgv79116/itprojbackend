    "overview": [
        "<p>Modern techniques have revolutionised biology and medicine, but interpretative and predictive tools are needed. Mathematical modelling is such a tool, providing explanations for counter-intuitive results and predictions leading to new experimental directions. The broad flavour of the area and the modelling process will be discussed. Applications will be drawn from many areas including population growth, epidemic modelling, biological invasion, pattern formation, tumour modelling, developmental biology and tissue engineering. A large range of mathematical techniques will be discussed, for example discrete time models, ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, stochastic models and cellular automata.</p>"
