    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject examines music in the European art music tradition during the long nineteenth century in its social, cultural and historical contexts. By examining musical works, historical documents, and modern scholarship, students explore not only how musical styles developed within this historical context, but also how the concept of \u201cWestern art music\u201d came to be constructed.</p>",
        "<p>In-class discussions, quizzes, and exercises support students as they examine the meanings of this music for listeners both past and present, as well as how these meanings were shaped by issues including gender, race, class, nationalism, colonialism, technology, and cross-cultural contact.</p>",
        "<p>Students complete an original research project on a topic of their choice, which may take the form of an academic research paper, a lecture-recital script, a public musicology project or a grant application.</p>",
        "<p>Assessment tasks and research methods workshops in tutorials support students as they plan, research, and complete their project.</p>"
