Multimodal studio foregrounds a range of Indigenous creative and cultural knowledges and practices in the creative arts and/or performance studio to consider how Indigenous knowledges can diversify and decentre colonial knowledges and knowledge production.</p>",

Students will be engaged in presentations, group work, peer critique and creative projects that utilise skills in art making and shared knowledges and diplomacies, and will work with respect and responsibility in relation to Indigenous cultural practices and protocols.</p>",
