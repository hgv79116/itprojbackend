    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will introduce the field of urban morphological analysis and a range of techniques for urban mapping. It will include techniques for mapping and analysis of various layers of urban data, for instance: figure/ground, grain size, building and public space typology, infrastructure, functional mix, movement networks, density, streetlife, character, viewsheds and pools of use. The focus will be on an understanding of how various techniques of urban mapping can creatively contribute to different urban design concepts, approaches and outcomes within a global context.</p>",
        "<p>Urban Morphological Mapping forms part of the Towards Practice Specialisation in the Bachelor of Design.</p>",
