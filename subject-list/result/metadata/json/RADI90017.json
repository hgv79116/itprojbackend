    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject covers chest, abdominal and musculoskeletal radiology and pathology. It aims to enhance observational, analytical and communication skills of radiology trainees in their 2nd year of RANZCR training whilst simultaneously providing a comprehensive foundation in critical and evaluative skills in image interpretation.</p>",
        "<p>Students will acquire a broad range of competencies, knowledge and understanding of key radiological diagnoses across a variety of imaging modalities for effective patient management and care.</p>",
        "<p>Teaching methods include lectures and interactive tutorial case based sessions facilitated by subspecialist expert radiologists and pathologists, with a focus on case based learning blueprinted to the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists (RANZCR) curriculum.</p>",
        "<p>Assessment tasks include oral case based and formal written examinations.</p>"
