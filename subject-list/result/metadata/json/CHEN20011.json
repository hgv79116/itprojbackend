    "overview": [
        "<p>Building on Fundamentals of Chemical Engineering (CHEN20012) and Material and Energy Balances (CHEN20010), this subject further explores chemical engineering processes and design, both on the large plant-wide scale and at the single unit operation scale with a quantitative approach to analysis and complexity commensurate with real world applications.</p>",
        "<p>A range of numerical methods are introduced in a problem-specific context, from CHEN20010 and CHEN20012.  This subject will focus on applying numerical methods in chemical engineering  processes at multiple levels, first on a fundamental molecular level, followed by the design of a particular product or unit operation all the way up to an overall engineering process on a plant-wide scale. Students are introduced to steady-state and unsteady-state process simulations using tools including simple spreadsheet packages, commercial-scale simulation packages widely used in the chemical process industry and basic programming. Being able to simulate material and energy balances on reactors and separation unit operations allows the students to optimally design processes to meet safety and sustainability requirements. The subject will include exercises in process optimisation and the solution of ill-defined process problems.</p>",
