    "overview": [
        "<p>Applied Crop Production and Management explores the science and technology of major Australian food crop production systems, to improve both yield and sustainability, with a particular focus on field crops, and annual and perennial horticulture crops. Topics covered will include the factors that influence yield such as plant genetic make-up, plant functioning, climatic zones, crop management practices including nutrient management, crop rotations, crop protection, and will also focus on measurement of crop yield. Consideration of the impact of climatic uncertainties and management practices will provide students with a sound understanding of the requirements of a profitable and sustainable cropping system, and the competencies needed to manage such a system. This subject will be delivered as combination of lectures, workshops and hands-on field and laboratory activities at the Dookie campus, and will capitalise on the proximity of Dookie to major cropping enterprises of the north central and Goulburn Valley regions.</p>"
