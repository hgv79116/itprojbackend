        "<p>The subject is the capstone subject for the Architecture major in the Bachelor of Environments. It is intended that the subject will integrate previous coursework in the major. The core of the undergraduate design sequence is the development of both design thinking and dexterity with tools. The focus of the investigations of this subject will be architecture in an urban context, which will be explored by students designing a particular building type, e.g. a theatre, a motel, a car park, a television studio, a school, etc. The project will engage with historical, theoretical, structural, and environmental ideas relevant to the specific project through the lectures and various set design exercises.</p>"
