    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is designed to help Fellows in the AFSE program develop their leadership skills through the study of well-known Indigenous leaders, theories of leadership and assessment of and reflection on their own leadership actions. The subject will critically examine concepts and definitions of leadership and how they have changed over time; Indigenous leadership within and outside formal roles and organisational settings; the exercise of leadership, power, and authority; and the role of values and ethics in leadership. Study, discussion and analysis of key leadership ideas will be complemented by experiential activities, case studies of Indigenous leaders, guest speakers, and opportunities for group discussion and critical self-reflection.</p>"
