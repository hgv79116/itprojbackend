    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will describe the development, function and regulation of cells of the immune system; immunoglobulins; cytokines; immunological mechanisms operating in immunity to infectious disease; autoimmunity; hypersensitivity; and transplantation and tumour immunology. Content will be presented across five modules that involve investigations into innate immunity, immune recognition, adaptive immunity immunoregulation and immune memory, as well as the involvement of the immune system in disease. Students will engage with the content through a variety of activities including lectures, active workshops and flipped classroom-style discussions. Through understanding each module in this subject, students will gain an appreciation of the fundamentals and underlying mechanisms of the immune system, which will build a foundation for further studies in Immunology.</p>"
