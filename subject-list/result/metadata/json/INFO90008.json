    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject involves in-depth investigation of a significant problem related to Human-Computer Interaction or a related discipline. The subject also provides students with skills and knowledge for analysing and solving problems, and enhanced written and oral communication skills. Under the supervision and guidance of an academic researcher, students are required to design and conduct a research investigation. This would typically involve a literature review, experimentation and data collection, and data analysis. The results will be reported as a thesis and in a public presentation. In some instances, it is expected that the results will also be submitted for publication in a conference or journal.</p>"
