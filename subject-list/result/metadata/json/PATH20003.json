Through a combination of laboratory and workshop sessions and case based lectures students will consolidate their theoretical understanding of disease acquired in PATH20001 or BIOM20001. Students will be introduced to the core disciplines of Pathology and in doing so appreciate the central and vital role Pathology plays in medicine and medical research.</p>"
