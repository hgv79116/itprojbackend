    "overview": [
        "<p>Underlying the undergraduate design course is the development of both design thinking and dexterity with tools and techniques. The focus of this design subject will be on generating design ideas, translating them into architectural forms, spaces, materials and programs. Students will learn how to refine architecture through consideration of spatial organisation, environmental context and structural necessity. Students will also learn how to communicate comprehensive architectural propositions through 2D- and 3D-modelling (physical and digital), visual and written media and oral presentations.<br/><br/>The focus in the design studio shifts to technologies and techniques in architectural practice. The studio assignments create an accretive conceptual investigation of fundamental principles into the making of buildings, including structure, enclosure, circulation, program, site, and light. An essential aspect of the design process is the incorporation of abstract thinking and abstraction within architectural production. <br/><br/>Critical use of diagramming, conceptual mapping, narratives, animations and performative expositions join with conventional techniques (plan, section, elevation, axonometric projections and perspectives) to generate and document design ideas.<br/><br/></p>",
        "<p>The design studio focuses on singular, medium-scale programs on prototypical sites, with the development scope of up to 1000m2.</p>",
