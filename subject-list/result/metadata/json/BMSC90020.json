        "<p>Neuroscience research is characterized by the breadth of its conceptual and technical approaches; students will discuss and debate a wide variety modern neuroscience research programs with leading neuroscience researchers. The focus is on research directed at understanding neural function at the level of circuits and systems. In-depth consideration of these programs will examine what dictates the choices of model systems and methods of analysis; what sort of technical and analytical skills researchers need to conduct their research; the factors that limits progress in the research programs, and what opportunities exit for the translation of research discoveries into therapies.</p>"
