    "overview": [
        "<p>The dichotomy Civilisation vs Barbarism has been one of the guiding fictions of Argentinian cultural history since 1845, when Domingo Sarmiento\u2019s Facundo: Civilisation and Barbarism was published. Written at a time of cultural crisis, this founding essay established a fundamental binary that would rule the rest of Argentina\u2019s history until today. The students will analyse the opposing sides and examine the peculiar dividing mentality created by the intellectuals of the country in the 19th century, which framed the first idea of Argentina. Its ideological legacy is in some sense a mythology of exclusion rather than a unifying national idea, a recipe for division rather than a consensus pluralism. Through a variety of readings and online activities, the subject invites you to explore, and contextualise globally, the realities and fictions that inhabit Argentina: a two-sided country, a place of contradictions.</p>",
        "<p>The subject is delivered in Spanish language, online, during the winter break. In a flexible and interactive mode, students will have the opportunity to integrate a variety of communication tools and collaborate with peers in a versatile and innovative environment. Students will thus enhance their digital literacy and practice skills as well as a number of skills relevant to a workplace environment, such as problem-solving, teamwork, clear communication, self-evaluation, information literacy and professionalism.</p>",
        "<p>Part of the assessment of this subject will contribute to the ePortfolio students develop in their Spanish and Latin American Studies subjects. This digital platform offers the opportunity to showcase relevant workplace skills and digital and intercultural competencies in the target language, as well as individual interests and ideas.</p>"
