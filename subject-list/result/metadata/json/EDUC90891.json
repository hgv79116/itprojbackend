    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject builds on the work of <em>EDUC90898 Introduction to Clinical Practice (EC)</em> to further develop the investigation into clinical teaching practices and strategies that support participation and learning of all children/students. It will examine how to collect evidence of the learner\u2019s current understandings to to extend this learning by designing learning sequences and lesson plans. Candidates will gain knowledge and understanding of how to provide timely and appropriate feedback to children/students about their learning. There will be analysis of how to use clinical judgements that support and extend the learner\u2019s thinking. Candidates will develop a range of strategies for reporting to children/students and parents/carers and develop understanding of the purpose of keeping accurate and reliable records of student achievement. Topics will include: Indigenous perspectives; theoretical paradigms to inform play-based pedagogy; young children as diverse learners; differentiated learning and teaching that meets the specific learning needs of learners across the full range of abilities; models of curricula; teaching for creativity. These topics underpin the learning as articulated in the Early Years Learning Framework (EYLF), and the Victorian Early Years Learning and Development Framework (VEYLDF); National Quality Frameworks (NQS); The Victorian Curriculum; Australian Curriculum.</p>"
