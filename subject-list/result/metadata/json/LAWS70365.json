    "overview": [
        "<p>International migration is a topic of ever-increasing interest as a result of globalisation of labour markets and demographic pressures in sending and receiving states. This subject analyses the framework of international law that regulates the flow of people across international borders as regular or irregular migrants. It also equips students to understand the human rights of migrants who live or work in countries outside the state of their nationality. The subject aims to give students a broad understanding of connections between relevant legal frameworks rather than detailed knowledge of specialised regimes, and it is not a course in domestic migration law. The subject draws on a mix of international and Australian case studies. </p>",
