        "<p>The enactment of the Anti-Monopoly Law in China in 2007 was a significant step in China\u2019s transition from a centrally planned economy to a socialist market economy. In a short period of time, China has become a globally important competition law jurisdiction and increasingly crucial area of study and practice for competition lawyers, businesses, and enforcement agencies within and beyond China.
