        "<p>Installations and Happenings forms part of the Event Design specialisation.</p>",
        "<p>This subject explores how small-scale events and temporary interventions can help designers and other stakeholder to reimagine public spaces. The subject\u2019s examples include street and land art, pop-up parks, temporary installations, guerrilla gardens, and street performances. These precedents provide opportunities to examine a diversity of political tactics and place-making tools that designer-citizens can use to question, activate, and revitalise urban environments. The subject consists of lectures and seminars with accompanying readings, workshops, site-specific research, experience-based tasks, and design experiments. Students will have an opportunity to explore hands-on strategies for working at a variety of sites and communities. These strategies will uncover, critiques, and reinvent social, cultural, environmental, and more-than-human conditions of place. This research will inspire students to design and test spatial interventions that can foster dialogue, build social capital, and address critical global-to-local issues.</p>"
