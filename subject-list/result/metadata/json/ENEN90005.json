        "<p><strong>AIMS</strong><br/><br/>Environmental Management ISO 14000 aims to provide students with the skills and knowledge to apply and help develop environmental management systems. The subject builds on the student\u2019s knowledge of risk management, such as that gained in CVEN30008 Risk Analysis, and develops their ability to identify, assess and manage environmental risk that arises from the construction and operation of manufacturing or infrastructure facilities. It also builds on knowledge about sustainability such as is learnt in the subject CVEN90043 Sustainable Infrastructure Engineering, and other management systems such as those learnt in CVEN90045 Engineering Project Implementation.<br/><br/>At the conclusion of the subject, it is expected that students should be able to work under supervision in a capacity where they are responsible for the maintenance of an existing environmental management system, or assist in developing a new system. They should also be in a position to conduct simple internal audits and assist in more complex internal audits. The subject does not provide students with sufficient practice and skills to immediately become an accredited auditor in Australia.</p>",
        "<p><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT</strong><br/><br/>Environmental Management ISO 14000 will cover the following related areas of study: the history of EMS from Demming Wheel to ISO 14000 series; the elements of an EMS; systems audit and review and gap analysis; legal requirements, due diligence document control, liability and ISO 9000 review; regulation and accreditation; community consultation; emerging issues in environmental management.<br/><br/></p>"
