        "<p>In this subject, students continue to build upon their knowledge of dance practice, widening their approach to engage in choreographic thinking.</p>",
        "<p>Dancers train through daily classes to maximise their movement potential \u2013 including through articulation and extension of the body \u2013 augmenting their range of movement for performance within diverse contexts whilst growing a moving identity that can propel their performance of presence into unfamiliar contact zones.</p>",
        "<p>Physical theatre and improvisation skills in partnering and tumbling are introduced as students gain enhanced knowledge about dynamic flow into and out of the floor. Dance Science and somatic practices continue to underpin students learning through an integrated approach that fosters creative resilience, safety, health, wellbeing and sustained attention. Music and musicality continue to be emphasised through the presence of live music and vocal exercises for dancers to enhance the feeling tone of their embodied dancing.</p>",
        "<p>Dancers train to articulate the body so that movements become more precise and refined. Dance phrases are integrated fully and adapted in relation to each individual student. Physical conditioning primes the dancer for more possibilities for movement. At the same time presence and movement awareness is taught through a multi-directional approach. Choreographic tools complement dance training providing the means by which dancers can start to shape their own movement worlds.</p>"
