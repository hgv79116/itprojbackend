        "<p>The assessment and development of deep subsurface CO2 l storage sites requires a diverse range of technical skills as well as a good understanding of regulatory and environmental protection requirements and objectives, and socio-political advocacy. This course comprises five days of lectures and practical exercises covering the workflow of technical / scientific assessments, discussing common problems and industry best-practice to achieve safe and secure geological storage of CO2. Following an introductory \u2018back-story\u2019 to carbon capture and carbon utilisation, the work flow will commence with basin and play scale analyses and rapidly focus onto portfolio management for storage site screening, storage site selection and site analysis for future appraisal and development operations.</p>"
