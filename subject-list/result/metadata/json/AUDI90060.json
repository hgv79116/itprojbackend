    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will encourage students to use sources along with basic research concepts and design to develop their ability to become evidence-based clinicians. Students will use basic statistics and assessments to make judgements and decisions on best practice forming development of clinical decision making. Students will participate in workshops and interactive sessions that will allow them to develop their analytical skills. On completion, students will be able to critically appraise evidence to establish valid conclusions that assist with interpreting, integrating and managing results and outcomes, ensuring best and safe practice.  </p>"
