        "<p>This subject builds participants\u2019 capacity to develop pedagogical knowledge and skills in order to improve language, literacy and numeracy (L,L&amp;N) outcomes for all students. Evidence is presented to demonstrate the importance of L,L&amp;N skills for success at school, future learning and for full participation in the community and the workplace.</p>",
        "<p>This subject explores the current definitions and the place of L,L&amp;N in the curriculum; examines Australian students\u2019 performance in national and international assessment programs. It supports the development of participants\u2019 own language, literacy and numeracy skills and as well as an understanding of first and second language acquisition and the development of critical numerical concepts and applications.</p>",
        "<p>This subject identifies the L,L&amp;N demands of the range of discipline areas taught in the secondary school, including the L,L&amp;N needs of interdisciplinary content areas and in relation to e-learning. It also builds participants\u2019 capacity to assess and respond to specialised learning needs of all students, including: gifted and talented, EAL, Indigenous and students with disability.</p>",
        "<p>This subject along with <em>Teaching and Learning Contexts 1 </em>and <em>Evidence Based Learning and Teaching 1, </em>requires participants to implement the Clinical Praxis Exam.</p>",
