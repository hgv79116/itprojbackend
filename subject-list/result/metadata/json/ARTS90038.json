    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is designed to introduce graduate students to a sequence of key women's texts across major historical periods. The set readings, which are all considered \u2018seminal\u2019 in feminist literary studies, span a number of different genres: polemic, memoir, epistolary non-fiction, the essay and the novel. Combining theoretical approaches with cultural history and careful close reading, the course is designed to trace continuity and change in the arguments and imaginaries of some of Britain's most influential women writers from the Enlightenment through to the early twentieth century. </p>"
