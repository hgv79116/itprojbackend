    "overview": [
        "<p>This elective focuses on integration of geospatial data into iterative, procedural, rapid, large-scale design modelling, using a range of emerging tools including GIS, 3D modelling, CIM (Civil Information Models) and associated scripts and plugins. In this subject you will develop methods to model and interact with complex built form, difficult terrains and integrate social, environmental, and ecological data into your design decision-making.</p>",
        "<p>This subject offers an opportunity to build upon prior skills and interest in areas such as biomorphic form making, 3D printing, photogrammetry, agent-based simulation, particle systems, material networks, online mapping, GIS analysis, motion graphics and performance-based design. It is recommended for students of urban design, landscape architecture, and architecture.</p>",
