    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will focus on mythical narratives from the ancient Greek and Roman traditions. Students will explore some of the central patterns and themes in classical mythology. These include narratives of birth and creation, war and the warrior, othering and inclusion, disaster, gods, and humans. We will explore how these symbolic themes are incorporated into a diverse range of myths including the birth of the cosmos, Zeus's rule over the world, the foundation of cities and peoples, heroes, and monsters.</p>",
        "<p>We will also be concerned with the story of Troy, which is arguably the quintessential Greco-Roman myth, and the many classical tales of metamorphosis. To uncover these myths and their meaning we will engage directly with literary and visual sources with a focus on epic, drama, art, and architecture. As we uncover the significance of these myths in the everyday lives of the Greeks and Romans, we will also question their role in the modern world and contemporary society.</p>",
        "<p>This subject requires students to access reading and lecture materials online in preparation for multidisciplinary and interactive seminars, which in the Winter offering are also online.</p>"
