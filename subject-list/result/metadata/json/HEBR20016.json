        "<p>This subject endeavours to consolidate and broaden students\u2019 Hebrew proficiency in the written and spoken form language and cultivate cultural literacy by engaging with a cross-section of themes pertinent to Hebrew language communities and societies. Through participation in regular conversation practices, the subject aims to further develop students\u2019 ability to communicate in informal settings and deepen students\u2019 competence in employing more formal cadences of modern Hebrew and using more specialised reading and listening skills through engaging with a variety of materials such as newspaper and magazine articles, listening to and watching film and television clips. Emphasis is also placed on furthering students\u2019 proficiency and comprehension of advanced grammar, syntax, sentence structures, and the integration of specialised terminology and idiomatic expressions. Students will also be able to craft more complex texts of different types (such as essays, short stories and reviews) and sharpen their analytical skills in evolving discussions related to contemporary and historical issues. At the end of the subject, students should have improved their written, oral and listening skills.</p>"
