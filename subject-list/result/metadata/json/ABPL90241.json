    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject explores and researches the representation and history of particular sites in Melbourne and elsewhere. The subject engages with considerations of place-making outside the design studio context, and the creative potentials of heritage documentation. The notion of site and place is explored through a number of theoretical themes and hands-on creative, representational techniques including mapping, photography, film, sound, writing and using archives. These themes are further investigated through the subject reader, lectures and seminar discussions. Equal emphasis is placed on theoretical problems of understanding contemporary and historical contexts, and creative, representational techniques for documenting specific places. The major submission requires a well researched and presented 'Atlas' that evokes \u2018change over time\u2019 and the memory of a place of choice. Typically, the culmination of the subject is an exhibition of Atlas projects.</p>"
