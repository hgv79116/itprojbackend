        "<p>The aim of this subject is to provide students with an enhanced understanding of law and legal practice in an Asian jurisdiction through:</p>",
        "<ol><li>intensive seminars;</li><li>supervision of a research project on an Asian jurisdiction; and</li><li>legal experience in an approved role in an Asia-based workplace setting.</li></ol>",
        "<p>The intensive seminars will be led by an expert in the chosen Asian jurisdiction and will offer an advanced introduction to the legal system of the jurisdiction. Students must actively participate in the seminars and will be assessed by an hour long in-class test.</p>",
        "<p>Students must also complete at least the equivalent of a 3-week unpaid work placement in the nominated Asian jurisdiction. Work placements must be hosted by an organisation approved by the subject coordinator. The work placement involves a minimum of 15 days' work. During work placement, students must carry out legally-oriented work that offers students a practice-based exposure to law and legal practice in the jurisdiction. The proposed work should build on the students\u2019 studies to date in the Melbourne JD, involve written legal research work and be of an appropriately demanding standard to model professional practice.</p>",
        "<p>Students will also be required to complete a research paper on a topic approved by the subject coordinator that engages actively with topical debates about law in Asia. This will be due after the work placement and seminar is complete and should be based on the work placement. Examples of areas that might be covered include Asian trade and investment flows and their significance for Australia businesses; managing risk in Asian investment; dispute resolution in Asia; human rights; public legal institutions, including the legal profession; the role of NGOs; and law reform.</p>"
