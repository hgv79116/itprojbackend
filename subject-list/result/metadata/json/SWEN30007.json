The subject also aims to give students an understanding of the importance of analysis, design and management activities within a development process and to provide a realistic environment in which students understand how the practical aspects of computer science and software engineering are applied to real world projects.</p>",
        "<p><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT<br/> </strong></p>",
        "<p>Students will work in teams to analyse, design, implement and test a non-trivial software system for a realistic client. A key part of the project is for students to develop and manage a repeatable process in order to deliver a quality software product Workshops will explore the application of theory to the project and include selected topics drawn from: requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing and software project management relevant to the phase of the project that students are currently working on.</p>"
