        "<p>Studio Studies 2 builds on the studio practice components introduced in Studio Studies 1, with an emphasis on broader investigative and experimental working processes.</p>",
        "<p>Students will develop a higher degree of conceptual aesthetic and practical ability in their work and begin to establish a more consistent self-directed studio practice. Students will also explore and develop links between their studio practice and the history and theory of art. Through individual studio tutorials and forums, students will start developing the ability to articulate and discuss their work and the work of others in a contemporary visual art context.</p>",
        "<p>The Professional Practice component will introduce students to local museums and galleries and establish a familiarity with practicing professional artists in the field. Students will develop regular visual artwork practices through application of effective time management strategies and maintain established foundations of sound occupational health and safety practices.</p>"
