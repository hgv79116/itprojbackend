    "overview": [
        "<p>Islam does not, in theory, recognise a distinction between religion and law because for Muslims both are derived from their god\u2018s revealed message. The result is the inevitable tension between Islamic beliefs and the modern (secular) nation state that lies at the heart of the politics of Islam in South-East Asia. It has become the subject of major global controversies and conflicts in recent decades, as religious and political leaders compete with, and \u2013 in most cases \u2013 accommodate, each other. This tension, and the legal, political and social controversies that result from it, are the focus of this subject, which is based on selected comparative case studies of efforts to achieve legal Islamisation from a range of countries in Australia\u2019s region. Teaching is led by a scholar who has conducted extensive fieldwork across South-East Asia and worked closely with Islamic legal institutions in the region. He is supported by guest lecturers specialising on South-East Asia, who will bring their own perspectives to class discussions.</p>",
        "<p>This subject examines the relationship between the modern nation state and Islam in Asia, focusing on the 240 million Muslims in Australia\u2019s South-East Asian neighbourhood.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>How the original Arabic-derived legal thought has been adapted in new Asian homelands</li><li>The essential position of Islamic legal traditions as an alternative authority to the contemporary nation state</li><li>Current political and religious controversies arising in South-East Asia. These will be selected from a range that may include:<ul><li>Islamic legal codes and laws for Muslims</li><li>The Qadi, Islamic judicial traditions and courts for Muslims</li><li>Islamic criminal punishment</li><li>Interest-free banking, \u2018Islamic economics\u2019 and commercial law</li><li>Islamic approaches to the status of women (<em>fiqh Al-Nisa</em>)</li><li><em>Zakat</em> and other forms of philanthropy</li><li>Education and the role of <em>madrasa</em> and <em>pesantren</em></li><li>The introduction of revivalist Islamic codes</li><li>Islamic radicalism and terrorist groups in South-East Asia, including Darul Islam, Jemaah Islamiyah and Al Qaeda.</li></ul></li></ul>"
