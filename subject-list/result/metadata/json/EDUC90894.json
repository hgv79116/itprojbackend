        "<p>This subject synthesises Teacher Candidates\u2019 understanding of the characteristics of professional knowledge, clinical practice and engagement for professional accountability when teaching children aged from three years to five years. Teacher Candidates will reflect critically on the ways in which educational theory and research inform practice in the context of an informal, play-based curriculum.</p>",
        "<p>Guided by the National Quality Framework, Teacher Candidates will demonstrate capacity to make sound clinical judgements and to independently deliver high impact clinical instruction for sustained periods engaging children in developmentally appropriate learning experiences. Mentor Teachers will continue to support Teacher Candidates in collaboration with academics who have relevant areas of expertise.</p>",
        "<p>The Clinical Teaching Practice seminars are framed by the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers at the Graduate Level. At seminars, Teacher Candidates will engage in collaborative learning and critical reflection.</p>"
