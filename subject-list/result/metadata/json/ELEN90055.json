        "<p><strong>AIMS</strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject provides an introduction to automatic control systems, with an emphasis on classical techniques for the analysis and design of feedback interconnections. The main challenge in automatic control is to achieve desired performance in the presence of uncertainty about the system dynamics and the operating environment. Feedback control is one way to deal with modelling uncertainty in the design of engineering systems. This subject is a core requirement in the Master of Engineering (Electrical, Electrical with Business, Mechanical, Mechanical with Business and Mechatronics).</p>",
        "<p><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT</strong></p>",
        "<p>Topics include:</p>",
        "<p>* Modelling for control, linearization, relationships between time and frequency domain models of linear time-invariant dynamical systems, and the structure, stability, performance, and robustness of feedback interconnections;</p>",
        "<p>* Frequency-domain analysis and design, Nyquist and Bode plots, gain and phase margins, loop-shaping with proportional, integral, lead, and lag compensators, loop delays, and fundamental limitations in design; and</p>",
        "<p>* Actuator constraints and anti-windup compensation.</p>",
        "<p>This material is complemented by the use of software tools (e.g. MATLAB/Simulink) for computation and simulation, and exposure to control system hardware in the laboratory.</p>"
