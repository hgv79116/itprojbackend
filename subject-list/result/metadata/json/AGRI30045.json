    "overview": [
        "<p>Precision Agriculture can be broadly defined as site-specific soil-crop or animal-specific management of agricultural production systems by leveraging on technology and data. This subject will build students\u2019 knowledge and skills in the key principles and practices of Precision Agriculture in a range of agricultural production contexts including broadacre cropping, horticulture and livestock farming. Frameworks and case studies of technological innovation, adoption and diffusion in the agricultural sector will be an integral component of the curriculum. Through a series of seminars, practicals, fieldwork excursion activities coupled with industry involvement, students will be equipped to work effectively in the increasingly networked, digital, automated and data-rich environment of primary production, and gain experience with Precision Agriculture equipment. Adopting a \u2018Big Data\u2019 perspective, students will acquire skills in agricultural/environmental data management and analysis, and their application to crops and animals</p>"
