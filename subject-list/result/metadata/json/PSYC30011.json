    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces mathematical modelling of psychological phenomena. It reviews the role of quantification in the development of psychology and provides a broad overview of contemporary mathematical approaches to the representation of psychological phenomena. In addition, the modelling of a number of specific psychological phenomena is examined in depth. In-depth topics will be selected from psychophysics; the foundations of psychological measurement; models for response times; models for memory and attentional processes; judgement and decision-making models; models for motor control; computational models for cognitive processes; psychological scaling and latent variable models; and mathematical models for social and organisational processes.</p>"
