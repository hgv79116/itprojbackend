To explore ways of representing the city two dimensionally, three dimensionally, four dimensionally (with time) and potentially fifth dimensionally (alternate future realities).",
        "To introduce students to design as a form of research. To be able to identify an urban design problem or challenge; set out a design research question and aim; articulate a design approach or method, test their approach with rigor to put forward an urban design proposition; and draw conclusions identifying weakness and strengths of their approach."

        "Formulation: Formulate a conceptual design proposal that tests a specific hypothesis or design method in the form of a speculative urban design proposition with rigor.",
        "Analysis: engage with contemporary forms of urban analysis techniques which may include solar, wind, energy modelling.",
        "Critique: Be able to demonstrate a critical assessment of precedents and their own design proposal \u2013 where are the strengths and weaknesses, what can be learned or concluded by the proposal? What further research would they do if they were continue with the project?"
