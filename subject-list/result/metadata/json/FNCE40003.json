        "<p>Numerical techniques focuses on the theory and application of numerical methods for solving financial problems. The applications may include option valuation, value at risk, term structure modelling, portfolio simulation and optimisation and capital budgeting. These applications motivate the study of matrix methods, the solutions of linear and nonlinear equations, interpolation and approximation methods, numerical integration and Monte Carlo methods. No prior programming experience is required as the principles of programming are covered.</p>"
