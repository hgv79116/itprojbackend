    "overview": [
        "<p>Internship in Development is an elective subject available to graduate students in Development and various cognate disciplines and fields of study. This subject aims to provide students with the opportunity to apply their knowledge and skills learnt in class and enhance their understanding of the current approaches to the broad field of development through a structured period of contributing as a temporary staff member in a government, non-government or private corporation inside or outside Australia. Students are able to select a host organisation to further develop their knowledge and skills in their chosen area of interest. The exposure to a different cultural, socio-political or organisational context provides students with vast opportunities to critically reflect on the relationship between theory and practice, and the thus the nature of development as they have studied it and as they observe it to be approached or practiced during their internship placement.</p>"
