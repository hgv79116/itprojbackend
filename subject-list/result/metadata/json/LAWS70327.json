    "overview": [
        "<p>In the aftermath of 9/11, the Bush Administration embarked upon its self-declared \u2018War on Terror\u2019 which included the establishment of Military Commissions to try some of the detainees in Guant\u00e1namo Bay. The subject involves a critique of the Bush Administration\u2019s approach to trials by Military Commissions and contrasts the system with prosecutions of terrorist offences in United States civilian courts both pre and post-9/11. Students in the subject will discover that there are viable and effective alternatives to trial by Military Commissions which still guarantee basic fair trial rights. The subject also considers policy approaches of the Obama Administration\u2014particularly the massive increase in drone strikes in preference to taking physical custody of targeted personnel and transferring them to Guant\u00e1namo Bay \u2013 as well as increasingly strident Australian counter-terrorism legislation. The lecturers combine extensive practical trial experience with detailed understanding of relevant legal regimes making the subject a dynamic learning experience.</p>",
