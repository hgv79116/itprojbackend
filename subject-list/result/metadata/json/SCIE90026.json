    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides an in-depth look into the methods, algorithms and techniques behind biomolecular structure determination. In particular, students will be exposed to prominent techniques in the field for example: X-ray Crystallography, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and cryogenic-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM). As part of a general introduction into measurement techniques students will visit state-of-the-art NMR, cryo-EM and X-ray facilities at the Bio21 Institute and the Australian Synchrotron. Using industry standard software packages, students will learn to input and handle data to reconstruct biomolecular structure and dynamics across the range of techniques. The computer based laboratories will be overseen by practitioners in the field. This multi-disciplinary subject is co-taught by staff in the School of Physics, Chemistry and Biomedical sciences. There is particular emphasis on integration of these disciplines with students receiving both theoretical and practical knowledge of fundamental and frontier research and development in biomolecular structure determination.</p>"

Students are required to take responsibility for their own participation and learning. They also contribute to the learning of other students in collaborative learning environments, demonstrating interpersonal skills and an understanding of the needs of other students. Assessment may include the outcomes of tasks completed in collaboration with other students. Students who feel their disability will impact on meeting this requirement are encouraged to discuss this matter with the relevant Subject Coordinator and Student Equity and Disability Support website:http://services.unimelb.edu.au/student-equity/home"
