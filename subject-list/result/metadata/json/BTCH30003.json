    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject enables students to develop knowledge and skills relevant to Australian and global biotechnology industry by exploring the challenges of research translation and commercialisation. Students will navigate the steps involved in taking novel discoveries from the research laboratory to market, considering a multitude of factors which help or hinder this goal, including intellectual property rights, government regulation, and market opportunities. Learning will be supported by examination of local and global companies pursuing biotechnology innovation, case studies of product commercialisation successes and failures, and analysis of relevant commercial and scientific information and data. In lectures, students will hear from a range of experts including scientific researchers, research translation consultants, and industry professionals. Assessment tasks will require students to explore factors driving the success of novel biotechnology products and practice hypothetical investments pitches.\u202f By the end of the subject, students should have the knowledge to scrutinize the ethical considerations and societal impacts of biotechnology innovation and commercialisation.</p>"
