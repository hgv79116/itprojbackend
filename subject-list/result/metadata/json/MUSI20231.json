        "<p>This <em>online </em>subject offered by <em>The Wilin Centre</em> introduces students to Indigenous music in Australia. Through case studies, the subject delivers insights from musicians and other experts on the styles, cultural contexts, and histories, of selected Indigenous musical practices and traditions.</p>",
        "<p>Webinars introduce a range of issues that will enrich students\u2019 understanding of Indigenous music, including: regional diversity in musical practices and styles; the relationships between musical practices, dance and other artforms; the impact of colonisation on musical practices; the role of music in societies; and, cultural and ethical issues to consider when approaching and representing Indigenous music and musicians.   </p>",
        "<p>Students will use knowledge from webinars, viewing and listening, reading, and discussion, to prepare a listening journal and either essay or creative portfolio. Students will also develop and submit a critical reflection on their learning experience. </p>",
        "<p>This subject provides students with the opportunity to develop awareness of Indigenous music and musicians in Australia, and to develop language and skills to approach, talk, and write, about this knowledge in a respectful and culturally appropriate manner.</p>",
