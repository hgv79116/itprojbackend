    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is designed for students who have completed Japanese 7 and can recognise around 800 kanji characters, or those who have similar experience. It will enhance students\u2019 academic literacy skills to conduct in-depth research related to Japan/Japanese. Students will establish advanced Japanese literacy and background knowledge in order to engage in international issues surrounding Japan. Students will develop understanding of various genres through reading, and discussing issues in modern Japanese society. Students will engage in a small scale research project on one of the chosen topics by further investigating the issue and by writing an opinion piece and presenting it to the class. Through the research project they will develop their research skills and will equip themselves with intercultural literacy by analysing issues from various perspectives and participating in group discussions. Additionally, students will also develop agency and critical perspective as a Japanese language user participating in the global community.</p>"
