    "overview": [
        "<p>UX is short for User Experience and is established within the disciplines of information technology, visual design and product design but is less well known with the built environment design professions. In this subject, we explore UX design for built environments by focussing on human-centred design that contributes positively to health and wellbeing. This subject will bring together designers and non-designers to develop skills to better research and understand the ways in which the built environment impacts diverse users. The partner subject called Evidence-based Design for Health &amp; Wellbeing takes a health planning approach to consider how research evidence might best be developed and adopted to influence decision-making. In this subject, we focus on ourselves and others as users. Students will begin by developing personas based on research and interviews. Students then undertake a UX assessment of and UX plan of improvement for a self-selected built environment setting applying skills and knowledge developed across the subject. The built environment can be broadly conceptualised as the human-made spaces and places in which we live, learn, work, recreate, socialise and rehabilitate. </p>"
