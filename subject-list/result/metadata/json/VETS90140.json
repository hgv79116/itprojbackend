    "overview": [
        "<p>During placements in animal production industry, animal welfare and zoo settings, students acquire skills in animal handling and observe and participate in a range of animal management practices. Integrating knowledge and understanding derived from other subjects in their course, students evaluate issues relating to animal health, welfare and production (and conduct critical analysis of data provided to them). Using case studies and experience in placements, students will develop skills analysing and interpreting problems relating to productivity, profitability, and sustainability in these systems, and will link theory to practice by analysing observed practices with critical appraisal of the literature.</p>"
