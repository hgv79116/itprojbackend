        "<p>This subject introduces students to the major factors influencing the health of production animals. Students will learn the principles of health, understand how to analyse data to identify disease, and investigate significant infectious and non-infectious causes of disease in production systems. Students will develop an understanding of how the type of production system will influence disease risk and development in production animals, and begin to understand how management of the whole production system is key in maximising animal health and production.</p>"
