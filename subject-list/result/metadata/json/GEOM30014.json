    "overview": [
        "<p>In this subject, students will learn about the principles, concepts and design strategies used in the development of spatial data infrastructures (SDI) and common data environments (CDE) as an enabling platform to facilitate integration, use, discovery and access of multi-sourced infrastructure data. Emphasis will be placed on both technological and institutional factors that facilitate the data integration. Students will examine related disciplines such as construction, land administration and civil engineering as well as technical areas such as digital twins and interoperability.</p>",
        "<p>The subject delivers SDI and CDE concepts and theory, current SDI and CDE initiatives, SDI, CDE development strategies and development models; SDI, CDE as an enabling platform, SDI and CDE and partnership approaches, financing and capacity building, challenges for developed and developing countries, capacity building, policy and privacy issues , metadata, standards and clearinghouses, SDI, CDE application areas, and SDI, CDE implementation and benchmarking.</p>",
        "<p>The subject is of particular relevance to students wishing to establish a career in infrastructure engineering, civil engineering, property management, surveying, spatial information and urban planning but is also relevant to a range of disciplines where imaging should be considered.</p>"
