        "<p>The field of Biotechnology encompasses many different advanced analytical techniques. The aim of this subject is to develop knowledge and skills in the application of these technologies. This subject will be taught by scientists who will discuss their own research involving the application of state-of-the art technologies designed to understand the composition of different organisms, protein modification, the structure and function of proteins, and the complexities of protein-protein interactions and metabolic outcomes. There will be a strong emphasis on how these technologies are applied to a range of areas in biology, medicine and industry. </p>",
