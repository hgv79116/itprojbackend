        "<p>The purpose of this subject is to help students develop the personal insights, ethical decision-making skills, and problem-solving methods that will be critical to being a successful entrepreneur. The subject will look at four interrelated cognitive and emotional domains. First, self-understanding, which will address where being an entrepreneur fits into the student\u2019s life and career, what strengths they bring, what the particular challenges will be for them, and how to set up and use opportunities for reflective learning. Second, self-management skills, which will focus on those which are especially important for entrepreneurs, including the resilience skills to handle pressure and failure, time and priority management skills, and the skills to manage success, including thinking critically and creatively. Third, ethical decision making, which will explore a person\u2019s values, different methods of making ethical decisions, the identification and management of cognitive biases, and the application of ethical decision-making skills to the type of concrete dilemmas faced by entrepreneurs. </p>"
