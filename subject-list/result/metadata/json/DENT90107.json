        "<p>Special Needs Dentistry 3 is the final subject that follows from the two years of specialist training that focuses on advanced aspects of special needs dentistry and how they pertain to complex patient centred care. Students will manage treatment of patients with complex care needs whilst considerations are taken into account with interdisciplinary care, public advocacy, role of autonomy and clinical decision making.</p>",
        "<p>Learning is achieved through a series of weekly 4-hour seminars, journal meetings and clinical placements, which occur throughout the teaching period.  Clinical placements are in major public hospital and Community Care Centres facilities that have dental clinics.</p>",
        "<p>Seminar presentations require students to present on several aspects pertinent to the particular semester. The seminars are on a 6-semester rotation and all post graduate students across the three years take part. The themes include: ageing, public dental health, the aged care system and domiciliary care; polypharmacy, saliva, common medical conditions facing the elderly; physical and intellectual disabilities; Oral pathology, oral medicine, oral cancer; medically compromised series 1, transplants, and palliative care; and blood and bleeding disorders. </p>"
