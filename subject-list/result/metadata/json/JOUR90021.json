    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject examines the practice of professional journalism and its traditions across a variety of international contexts. Students will compare and contrast the intellectual and historical traditions behind the development of contemporary journalism practice in places including Australia, Europe, Africa, North and South America, and Asia. They will critically analyse how technological innovations and social transformation have driven changes in the field. Students also will engage with debates regarding the influence of international norms and Anglo-American conceptions of journalism in non-Western contexts, and reflect on the degree to which these entanglements have led to a form of modern global journalism.</p>"
