        "<p>This subject will focus on recent advances and insights in evolutionary and populations genetics and genomics. It will extend basic knowledge in these areas gained during a student\u2019s undergraduate degree and will consist of blocks of themed lectures, workshops, written reports and student oral presentations. The subject provides students with skills and knowledge for understanding original research and enhanced written and oral communication skills. The subject will be offered in alternate years. </p>"
