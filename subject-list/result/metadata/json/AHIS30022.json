    "overview": [
        "<p>This class focuses on artistic encounters between European cultures and other world cultures between about 1300 and 1650. The goal is to place the art and culture of Europe into an expanded geopolitical sphere, and to explore particularly important and representative moments within the larger exchange of people, objects, ideas, and materials in the early-modern period. Readings will be drawn from both period sources and contemporary art history; and tutorials will focus whenever possible on objects in University and Melbourne collections.</p>"

        "Understand how materials and technologies of art were affected by travel and trade",
        "Gain a deeper understanding of basic shared themes in early-modern art, including a changing relation to the past in China and Italy, a search for new world audiences and new technologies in Benin and New Spain, or the engagement with violence and eroticism in Japan and France."
