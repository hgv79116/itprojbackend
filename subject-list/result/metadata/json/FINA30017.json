The seminar content reflects particular research initiatives of staff presenting and provides opportunity for students to explore in depth a specific theme that is relevant to contemporary cultural movements and is intellectually innovative in its field.</p>",
        "<p>Critical and Theoretical Studies 5 develops from Critical and Theoretical Studies 1\u20134, introducing more advanced modes of critical interpretation and analysis in the visual arts, and is designed to complement accompanying studio-based programs.</p>"
