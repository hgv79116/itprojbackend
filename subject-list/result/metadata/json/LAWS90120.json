    "overview": [
        "<p>Drawing on key examples from Australia, the Western Pacific and South east Asia regions, with some reference to other regions of the world, this subject examines how the law may be used as a tool to improve public health and prevent illness and disease. It also considers how laws may negatively impact the public\u2019s health if not carefully crafted. In Public Health Law, students will develop specialised knowledge of the legal basis for public health regulation and of particular domestic laws that are relevant to a variety of critical contemporary public health issues. They will also examine the role of domestic law in relation to global public health issues and international law. The subject will complement the Melbourne Law Masters subject Global Health Law, but it is also intended to be studied independently and no prior knowledge will be assumed. Specific areas of public health concern that will be considered include communicable diseases; family health, gender and the life course; health system strengthening and universal health care; health security and emergency responses; and non-communicable diseases. The subject will also examine the law\u2019s reach and limits noting other tools that play a vital role in achieving public health.</p>",
