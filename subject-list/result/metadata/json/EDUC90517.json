        "<p>This subject provides participants with the opportunity to investigate an aspect of teaching and learning of mutual interest to them and to their departments. Supported by workshops, individual mentors and networks, each participant develops a complete and viable research proposal in an area of relevance to teaching and learning in their department/faculty. The completed report may subsequently be used as the basis for an application for funding and/or further research studies such as a Masters-level research project.</p>"
