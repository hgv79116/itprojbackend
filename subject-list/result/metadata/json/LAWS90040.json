    "overview": [
        "<p>In this subject, students explore the external constraints on construction. These are legal, via the public law of land use planning (sometimes called development control or zoning) and of applicable construction standards; and via the private law rights of those close to the project site. But they are also extra-legal, via community pressures to stop or modify planned development. The subject takes a comparative common law approach, considering a selection of Australian states and territories (including Victoria) and New Zealand, but also England and Wales, whose law remains the origin of the relevant law in Australasia, as well as in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and most of North America.</p>",
        "<p>Philip Britton has extensive construction law teaching experience at King\u2019s College London and in the Melbourne Law Masters and has published on \u2018neighbour issues\u2019 in construction. Melbourne colleagues will also contribute, together with guest speakers from \u2018the field\u2019.</p>",
        "<p>This subject provides an examination of the legal and non-legal issues which operate as external constraints on construction projects, within a comparative common law context.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>The public law of land use planning: its aims, structures, operation in practice and openness to legal challenge</li><li>The law of \u2018building control\u2019, via applicable construction standards: definitions, operation, enforcement and inspectors\u2019 powers, including ongoing reforms in Victoria</li><li>The private law rights \u2018neighbours\u2019 enjoy against the negative aspects of construction, via property/land law and the law of tort</li><li>The remedies available in court for actual or potential infringement of these rights and judges\u2019 approaches to the choice of remedy, including (in particular) to the assessment of damages</li><li>How the structuring of the project may determine who bears the ultimate cost (or liability) if a neighbour successfully challenges the whole project, or where or how it is being constructed</li><li>The powers (legal and extra-legal) of community action groups to influence decisions about new construction and how project sponsors may respond.</li></ul>",
