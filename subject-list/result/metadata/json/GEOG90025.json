    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject consists of a 12-day field trip to East Timor in the mid-year break, with a series of compulsory pre-departure information sessions in late semester 1 and a post-trip workshop in early Semester two. The subject is designed to develop students\u2019 understanding of the Asia-Pacific region and in particular of the complex geographies of small island and post-conflict states. Students will gain an in situ appreciation of the historical and contemporary issues relevant to East Timor and develop their empirical and analytical research skills while carrying out small group research into the impacts of conflict, climate and culture on social and economic development and the environment. While in East Timor, students will participate in a number of rural, urban and remote site visits during which time they will interact with local communities, civil society leaders, academics, government and aid organizations.</p>",
        "<p>The East Timor Field Class subject (GEOG30026/GEOG90025) involves a full program of activities comprising travel to and around East Timor, including across remote and rough terrain using various modes of transportation (car, boat, foot). Students will be provided with privileged access to local Timorese communities and experiences, in both an urban, regional and rural setting. The East Timor Field Class subject can be emotionally and physically demanding and will include a level of personal intensity and challenge, and students are expected to be active managers of their own personal health and safety (with the support of teaching staff). A further field work plan, risk assessment, with Faculty OHS team review and approval, covering COVID-19 global pandemic and general field/travel risk mitigation  in the East Timorese and Australian context will be carried out in consultation with students closer to departure.</p>"
