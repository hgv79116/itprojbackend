    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides a detailed knowledge of vegetation structure and natural values of Victorian plant communities and their assessment, including environmental limiting factors, threats due to land use, development and fragmentation, and management issues related to environmental impact assessment and conservation of native vegetation. The subject will be based around short excursions to examine different vegetation types in the Melbourne region, and a series of special lectures by scientists, managers and consultants from both the government and private sectors. Topics will include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>ecology and natural history of Victorian plant communities;</li><li>environmental impacts and vegetation assessment;</li><li>conservation and management issues (e.g. revegetation, rare species, fauna habitat, weed invasions);</li><li>biodiversity legislation and government agencies;</li><li>consulting services and client focus.</li></ul>"
