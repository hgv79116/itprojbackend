        "<p>The research project is involves undertaking experimental and/or theoretical research in an area currently relevant to one of the research groups in the School of Chemistry. The subject will enable students to develop the process and practice of chemical research; increase the student's knowledge and understanding of chemical science; encourage the development of individual investigative skills, critical thought and the ability to evaluate information and to analyse experimental data; and ensure that students receive essential training in laboratory safety procedures.</p>",
        "<p>Students enrol in a total of 62.5 points of research project across the duration of the Honours program. This is achieved by enrolling in two of subjects across two consecutive semesters to achieve a total 62.5 credit points. Students enrol in a Part 1 subject in the first semester and a Part 2 subject in the second semester of the program.</p>"
