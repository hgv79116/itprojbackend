    "overview": [
        "<p>The epidemiology of infectious diseases differs from chronic disease - cases may be the source of infection for further cases, immunity is an important factor in disease transmission and control, and there is often the need for urgency in the detection and response to disease.</p>",
        "<p>This subject introduces students to the strategies used to identify and respond to infectious disease problems. Content is updated weekly to incorporate topical infectious disease events, and emphasis is given to a practical understanding and application of infectious disease epidemiology. Students will learn the basic principles of infectious disease surveillance and response, and will develop the terminology, and written and oral skills for effective reporting. Students will also develop problem-solving skills in scenario-based exercises.</p>"
