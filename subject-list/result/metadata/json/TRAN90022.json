    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject places students in a professional translation environment, whereby students work on team-based translation projects that require them to integrate their linguistic, technical and collaborative skills, and to experience the variety of roles in professional translation such as client, editor and proofreader. It will provide students with the opportunity to gain extended industry experience through project work. Students will engage with industry collaborators and asked to manage real translation projects. They will work in teams to recommend potential avenues for improvement, refinement or evaluation of an existing project that is identified or deemed of interest by the industry collaborators. In small teams students will present the results to an audience of industry specialists, clients and peers. Students will be exposed to the rigour of processes undertaken in the industry.</p>"
