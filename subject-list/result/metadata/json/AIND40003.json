        "<p>This subject will investigate social and political processes intended to lead to the achievement of emancipatory goals. Specific Australian social movements and histories related to Aboriginal empowerment and social amelioration will be contextualised within theoretical frameworks including postcolonial, critical race and whiteness. This subject introduces decolonising methodologies for examining the relationship of contemporary \u2018selves\u2019 to histories, power structures and social transformation. Students explore the tensions and ethics around positionality, reflexivity, storytelling and creative activism.</p>"
