    "overview": [
        "<p>Mediation has become the likely forum for the resolution of most disputes \u2013 whether convened voluntarily, by contract, statute or court order \u2013 but its inherent confidentially makes it hard for outsiders to understand fully.</p>",
        "<p>This subject will cover the majority of the material required for Accreditation under the National Mediator Accreditation Scheme (NMAS), but also recognise that mediation needs to be understood by all involved, not just future mediators.  In light of this, it will examine the roles of solicitors and barristers, other advisers and experts, and the parties themselves. It will do this through teaching by Andrew Moffat, who regularly mediates commercial disputes in Melbourne and Sydney, supplemented by guest lecturers who fill these roles in mediations.</p>",
        "<p>It also recognises that mediation is \u2013 and must maintain \u2013 a uniquely flexible process capable of very different approaches based on the context of the dispute. Guest lecturers who are expert practitioners in other dispute contexts will share their insights.</p>",
        "<p>Students will develop a sophisticated understanding of current mediation theory and practice, and learn to put this learning into practice as mediators and mediation participants, through extensive involvement in simulations. Finally, students will learn about the mediation industry and the business and career elements of developing a mediation practice.</p>",
        "<p>Successful completion of this subject, and a complete attendance record to all sessions, is expected to be credited for 60 per cent of National Mediator Accreditation Scheme training, under the auspices of the Resolution Institute, which will offer students the opportunity to study the remaining 40 per cent required for NMAS accreditation.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Mediation within the broader context of dispute resolution</li><li>Moving from positions to interests</li><li>Standard NMAS mediation model</li><li>Key concepts \u2013 voluntariness and empowerment</li><li>Triggers for mediation \u2013 optimising timing where possible</li><li>Mediator skills and when and how to intervene</li><li>Changing dynamics in joint sessions</li><li>Mandatory mediation as public policy</li><li>Typical participants and their roles</li><li>Alternatives and options in private sessions</li><li>NMAS Approval and Practice Standards</li><li>Setting the scene \u2013 the opening statement</li><li>Mediation challenges \u2013 complexity and ethical issues</li><li>Optimising mediation in cross-cultural disputes</li><li>Mediation as a career.</li></ul>"
