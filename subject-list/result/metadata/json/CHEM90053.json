        "<p>This subject deals with how ultrasound interacts with bubbles in a liquid to generate sonochemical reactions. The production of functional nano- and micro materials using ultrasound, and how surface-active solutes affect sonochemical reactions will be discussed. The use of sonochemistry to decompose organic pollutants, for synthesising biofunctional materials and in other specific applications will also be discussed.</p>"
