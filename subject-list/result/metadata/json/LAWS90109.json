    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject offers a history of the role of legal thought in international politics from the late middle ages (1300) to the present. It examines the development of legal thought in its context, as part of religious, economic and ideological projects that have often coincided with efforts to strengthen the power of European nations vis-\u00e0-vis each other and in the colonies, and with resistance to those efforts. Particular attention is given to describing the development of legal thought as a whole, combining aspects of public law sovereignty with those of private law and the right to property. What will emerge is a description of law as a vocabulary that has been used (and continues to be used) to seize, exercise and challenge international power in its many manifestations. The chronology will extend from debates over the power of the church vs. state in the late middle ages, the justification of empire and free trade from the 16 th and early 17 th centuries, the consolidation of \u201cEuropean Public Law\u201d in the 18 th century, and the various transformations undergone by \u201cmodern\u201d international law in its liberal and neoliberal forms from the late-19 th to the late-20 th centuries.</p>",
