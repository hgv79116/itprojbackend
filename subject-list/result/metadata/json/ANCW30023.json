    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject combines traditional classroom teaching and learning with hands-on fieldwork and workshop exercises to enable students to develop a working knowledge of practical archaeology and its methods within the context of modern research and archaeology in Australia and the Old World (the Near East, Mediterranean and Europe). The subject assumes no prior knowledge of archaeology. It will introduce students to some of the main fieldwork, scientific and interpretive methods involved in practical archaeology. Students will use the University's extensive classics and archaeology collection to develop their practical skills and knowledge about how we can record and interpret the past from archaeological data.</p>",
        "<p>Note: The tutorials are organised according to four \u2018blocks\u2019 (each approx. 3 hours duration): surveying; fieldwork (simulated excavation); artefact analysis; and study of standing monuments.</p>"
