    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will build on Foundation Physiotherapy Sciences A to provide physiotherapy students with additional conceptual and evidence-based background in biomedical sciences that underpin physiotherapy clinical practice and research. It will build on and integrate prior knowledge of anatomy to an understanding of physiology and pathology in the areas of cardio-respiratory, musculoskeletal and neurological systems. Students will be expected to apply this knowledge in appropriate cases as a basis for developing clinical reasoning and decision-making skills in physiotherapy practice. The subject will be completed with an integration of body systems around complex problems.</p>"
