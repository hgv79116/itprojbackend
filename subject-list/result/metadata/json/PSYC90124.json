    "overview": [
        "<p>As agents of change, consultants play a key role in developing and disseminating solutions to complex societal and organisational problems. Principles of Consulting provides a systematic exploration of core consulting themes, frameworks, and skills while focussing on specific real-world problems through the application of psychological theories and research methods. The subject combines didactic teaching to increase student\u2019s understanding of commonly used tools and methods in consulting with case-based practice to design and purpose evidence-based interventions grounded in psychological research. With soft skills being an essential quality of capable consultants, students will work collaboratively in teams to refine their written communication and oral presentation skills. Students will also work on developing a professional identity, including an e-portfolio, which they can deploy to stand out in a competitive job market. This is a compulsory subject in the Master of Applied Psychology.</p>"
