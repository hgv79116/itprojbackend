        "<p>This practice-oriented subject allows students to develop their ability to build and utilise good working relationships with internal and external clients. Feedback from industry indicates that these 'consulting skills' are highly valued, and an important factor in employment and promotion decisions. Information systems professionals learn that technical knowledge is seldom sufficient in itself, and must be supported by the ability to understand, communicate and collaborate with clients.</p>",
        "<p>Students work individually and in syndicate groups. Classes are interactive and focus on practice, with reading and research tasks undertaken largely outside class. Most classes feature a guest speaker from industry.</p>",
        "<p>Topics covered include understanding business and management needs, setting and managing expectations, reporting and staying on track, giving advice, written and verbal communication, consulting ethics, and the business of consultancy.</p>",
        "<p>The subject will enhance students\u2019 ability to manage relationships with stakeholders, communicate effectively about IS services, and engage effectively with senior decision makers in organisations.</p>",
