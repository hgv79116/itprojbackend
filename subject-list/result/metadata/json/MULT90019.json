    "overview": [
        "<p>Students enrolled in this subject will undertake a placement in a professional working environment in conjunction with coursework intended to enhance their placement and their employability. The coursework component of the subject acts as preparation and additional support for the placement by conveying an understanding of organisations and operational aspects of organisations such as planning, communications, policy and equality in the workplace. The placement will give students direct exposure to professional practice in their chosen field, working under the guidance of a senior staff member with additional support from the subject coordinator. As well as taking part in the host organisation's day\u2010to\u2010day work, students will undertake fortnightly seminars and a research project of concrete and practical benefit to the host organisation or the broader industry. Students seeking to undertake the research internship in their current place of employment must consult the subject coordinator.</p>"
