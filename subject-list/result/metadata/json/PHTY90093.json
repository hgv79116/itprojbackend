        "<p>Healthcare in Context 1 is the first of two subjects that develops students\u2019 knowledge and skills in community healthcare. Students will work in small groups with an identified community to learn more about the determinants of health and to complete a community Health Needs Analysis. They will build knowledge of the bio-psycho-social and ecological models of health and the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health and critically apply this knowledge to their community engagement. Students will specifically learn theory relating to the selection of an ethically and culturally sensitive \u2018Needs Analysis\u2019 instruments that will inform them on the health and wellness priorities of the community. Students will administer the Needs Analysis instrument to key stakeholders from their community and gather data on the \u2018felt, normative, expressed and comparative\u2019 needs of the community. They will draw on knowledge and skills learned in Research and Evidence 2 to analyse the qualitative and quantitative data gathered. Students will spend a minimum of 10 hours on their community engagement project. Their involvement as a health researcher will be situated within the context of community health practice and health promotion from the perspective of primary healthcare.</p>",
        "<p>To further expand on their understanding of diverse and complex healthcare contexts, students will have the opportunity to choose from 2 \u2018placement\u2019 selectives that will allow them to compare and contrast different models of healthcare as practiced locally and globally. The selective will involve a three week clinical or professional management experience that will draw from the following:</p>",
        "<p>Selective 1) Global selective. Students will have an opportunity to travel including overseas, rurally or remotely to build their understanding of diversity of community contexts.</p>",
