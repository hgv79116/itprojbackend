        "<p>How does law respond to experiences of war, mass conflict and political transition? This question has animated conflicts throughout the world, from South Africa to the Democratic Republic of Congo, from Argentina to the Arab Spring, from the former Yugoslavia to North America, Syria to Australia. This subject explores the languages and institutions of international criminal law. It is an area of law that exists at the confluence of criminal law, international law, human rights and transitional justice. The discipline will be approached historically, critically and theoretically, and includes in-depth case studies of institutions, crimes, procedures, and country or regional situations.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics in the subject include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>The history of international criminal tribunals and courts, from Nuremberg to the International Criminal Court;</li><li>Core crimes, such as war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, and aggression;</li><li>Selected crimes, such as enforced disappearance, rape and sexual violence;</li><li>Doctrines of criminal responsibility, such as individual criminal responsibility and modes of participation;</li><li>Procedures of prosecution and testimony;</li><li>Victims and international criminal justice;</li><li>National and regional approaches to international crimes, such as Australian war crimes prosecutions, or the InterAmerican Court of Human Rights; and</li><li>Alternatives to criminal trials, for example truth commissions and memory projects.</li></ul>"
