    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject explores the concepts of global childhoods and contemporary multicultural societies with a focus on Indigenous Worldviews and sustainable communities. This includes engaging with understandings about the past, present and future childhoods, relationships between teachers\u2019 values and beliefs and their pedagogies, and of how culture, beliefs and values shape childhoods through educational policy and practices. Issues in relation to policy, curriculum, quality, pedagogical practices, and assessments will be critically analysed. Contemporary issues around social justice, equity and diversity, and intercultural relationships will be interrogated.</p>"
