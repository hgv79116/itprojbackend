        "<p>Melancholy is an affliction associated with fear and fertility, madness and genius, manic creativity and aphasic stupor. A \"sacred disease\", from its original diagnosis in antiquity, melancholy has been characterised throughout history by its deep ambiguity and by the breadth of its influence over a range of expressions of thought and art. This subject will explore the different meanings of melancholy, from antiquity to the present day, in four major creative fields: literature, film, music and visual art. Taught by internationally published and recognised experts on the topic, this subject will involve students in rigorous discussion and analysis of core written, visual and music texts. Participation in the subject will engage students in preparatory reading, an expert-guided floor talk at the National Gallery of Victoria, a film screening and a music master class. Student familiarity with one or more of the four fields is desirable but by no means essential.</p>"
