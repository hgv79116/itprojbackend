        "<p><strong>This subject has been designed and developed for online delivery and assessment only.</strong></p>",
        "<p>Making Micro Documentaries immerses students with little formal filmmaking or arts backgrounds in the process of shooting short unscripted films or documentaries. With the evolution of digital technology, filmmaking has moved from the silver screen to the mobile phone and other hand-held devices.</p>",
        "<p>The explosion of social media platforms has established the micro movie as an important form for generating and disseminating knowledge. Making Micro Documentaries examines methodologies for devising, producing and distributing short films, and how they can be used to support and enhance the student's own academic output.</p>",
        "<p>The <em>online</em> subject asks participants to use their own devices for audio and video capture, editing and post-production. During the subject students will shoot a series of micro movies to explore how moving images engage with, and represent, the <em>real</em> world.</p>",
        "<p>The practice-led program will be framed by critical analysis and historical contextualisation. Reviews of the micro movies produced during the subject will provide an environment in which students can further reflect on the filmmaking process, and develop their own creative voice.</p>"
