        "<p>Computing programming can be used to solve problems in many diverse areas, such as business, science, humanities, and design. Many tasks in these areas require manipulating, analysing, and visualising data and media using computer programs. This subject teaches students with little or no background in computer programming how to design and write basic programs using a high-level procedural programming language, and to solve simple problems using these skills, with a specific focus on media computation, such as manipulating images and dynamic web content.</p>",
