    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is the culmination of each student's studies in Master of Urban Design. It will consist of a number of autonomous studio groups offering a range of opportunities for students to demonstrate an original approach to design synthesis in urban design, which is based on research and critical thinking. These studios will offer an interdisciplinary experience, and in some cases students may be working alongside others in a parallel design discipline.</p>",
        "<p>Students will be expected to demonstrate mastery of conceptual engagement with the shaping of urban space, design resolution, and aesthetic expression.</p>",
        "<p>With course coordinator approval, high-achieving students may undertake the Urban Design Thesis as an individually supervised design investigation. Similarly, under exceptional circumstances and with course coordinator approval, the Urban Design Thesis may be undertaken as a written thesis (see ABPL90067).</p>"
