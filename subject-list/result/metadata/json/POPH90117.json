        "<p>This subject introduces students to a variety of sources of routinely collected health-related data and how these data are used to derive population measures of fertility, mortality and morbidity, and to measure health service utilisation, disease registration and reporting. You will also learn how to develop, design and deliver a valid and reliable health questionnaire, and how to design and implement a survey using an efficient sampling strategy, and to analyse and interpret the resulting data.</p>",
        "<p>Topics include: routinely collected health-related data; quantitative methods in demography, including standardisation and life tables; health differentials; design and analysis of population health surveys, including the role of stratification, clustering and weighting.</p>"
