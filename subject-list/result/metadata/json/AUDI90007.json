    "overview": [
        "<p>Clinical Audiology B is a year-long subject that builds on the knowledge and clinical skills obtained in first year. As a clinical subject it encompasses the clinical placement program, but also a theory arm that explores advanced aspects of clinical assessments, including complex cases, specialist diagnostic procedures and global health concepts. The assessments incorporate a combination of clinical skills and theoretical applications. Learning activities include on-line modules, in class workshops, inquiry and problem-based learning and peer learning activities.</p>",
        "<p>The subject is part of the clinical placement program. Students should be expected to be allocated to clinical placements at the University Clinic and across metropolitan and rural services including hospitals and community settings.</p>",
