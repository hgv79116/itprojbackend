    "overview": [
        "<p>Indonesia\u2019s emergence as a democratic and decentralized power and Southeast Asia\u2019s only member of the G20 is transforming its relations with its ASEAN neighbours as well as the major regional powers. As a functioning democracy and the largest Muslim nation, Indonesia has a particular position in the global Islamic community. Moreover, a distinctive and activist foreign policy faces profound challenges from geopolitical shifts and from the vicissitudes of globalisation. These same geopolitical shifts will also transform Indonesia-Australia relations, albeit in uncertain ways. This subject will address the effects of the interaction of domestic and international factors on Indonesia\u2019s future trajectory as a nation-state, locating Indonesia as an agent within historical and contemporary global dynamics. To augment the regular classroom sessions, Indonesian and Australian experts and practitioners will also provide guest presentations.</p>",
        "<p>The subject is usually taught two times per year. It is available either as a semester-long subject taught on the Parkville campus or as an overseas intensive subject.</p>",
        "<p>The overseas offering will be taught intensively on location at the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences at the University of Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia. The subject will consist mainly of seminars held at the Faculty, with some field visits in Jakarta. Please note that there is a pre-teaching requirement, during which time students will be required to access subject materials on the LMS, and attend a pre-departure briefing on-campus.</p>",
