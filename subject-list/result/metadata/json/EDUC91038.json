        "<p>The Victorian 7 \u2013 10 Chemical Sciences Curriculum will be the content focus for this subject. Science inquiry and literacy practices will be the major pedagogical focus for this subject. This will be done through consideration of the Victorian 7 \u2013 10 Chemical Science curriculum. Teachers are supported to understand areas of the curriculum that pose conceptual difficulty for students and to plan for and implement strategies to enhance students\u2019 learning, including formative assessment tasks.</p>",
        "<p>Evidence based literature will be used to consider how inquiry can best be designed and incorporated into the science curriculum. By utilizing and evaluating both digital and non-digital resources, teachers will reflect on approaches to inquiry that can enhance students\u2019 understanding of scientific process while developing the language and skills for effective science communication.</p>"
