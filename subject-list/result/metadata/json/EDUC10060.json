    "overview": [
        "<p>Focused on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education, this subject examines the place and significance of Australian Indigenous peoples in the educational landscape. The subject will explore the changing nature of Indigenous education in Australia through studying a range of contemporary and historical views of Indigenous education. Attention will be given to the development of Australian Indigenous theory and research and its application to education. The United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) will form the starting point of this subject. It will also explore the location of Australian Indigenous education in the global indigenous education context, including comparisons with New Zealand, Canada and the USA.</p>",
        "<p>Students will develop knowledge of and the ability to engage in education initiatives that support communities, in addition to working with non-Indigenous people to support anti-racist and decolonizing practices in education. This subject provides students with an introduction to Indigenous education in Australia.</p>"
