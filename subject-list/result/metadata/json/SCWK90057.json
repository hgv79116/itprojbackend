    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is designed to introduce students to social work practice through the interventions of group work and community work. Several theoretical frameworks for group and community work will be explored and this will be contextualised in the current policy and political climate. Using case studies and field examples the subject will explore issues of marginalisation, power, culture and diversity and how this impacts work with groups and communities. The subject aims to develop knowledge and skills in creating change through effective group work and community work practice </p>"
