It will expose them to key themes, issues and theories of strategy, with a particular focus on the role of leadership in developing and implementing strategy for business success. There will be a strong emphasis on using theoretical knowledge to solve practical problems, which will be achieved through the use of case studies and discussion of contemporary business problems. Students who complete the subject should have a sound theoretical and applied understanding of the role of strategic leadership in business success. Topics covered will include: the role of strategy in business performance; the impact of environments on strategy; the role of leadership in strategy formulation and implementation; working with multiple stakeholders; strategic decision making; and leadership in corporate social responsibility.</p>"
