    "overview": [
        "<p>Human migration is a defining feature of our world. Students will be introduced to key theories, concepts, trends, spatial patterns, and contemporary issues arising from international and internal migration. The topics covered will consider the scale and complexity of human mobility, including refugees and forced displacement; rural to urban migration; environmental disaster and displacement; labour, education and skilled migration; health, well-being and migration in the life course. The socio-cultural contexts, factors, and outcomes of migration will be examined drawing on perspectives from demography and human geography. Students will critically explore theories about the \u2018push and pull\u2019 factors that drive migration, and consider the implications, challenges, and opportunities of human migration ranging from the personal to the geopolitical level.</p>"
