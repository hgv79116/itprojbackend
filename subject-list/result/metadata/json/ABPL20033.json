        "<p><strong>This subject was formerly known as Construction Analysis.</strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject explores the idea of construction as a process that strategically links structural principles to building elements, systems, materials, and techniques. The subject also covers key elements of building services and sustainability, including strategies to achieve internal comfort (related to building orientation, envelope, heating and cooling, air quality, acoustics, water and waste). Using a set of given case studies, students are asked to review and describe the physical anatomy of Australian residential buildings, emphasising how architectural ideas are conventionally translated into sustainable technological solutions. Students are asked to calculate how buildings perform, therefore understanding their impact on the environment.</p>",
