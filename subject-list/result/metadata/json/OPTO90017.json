        "<p>This subject provides advanced critical appraisal of contemporary and controversial issues in vision science. Each week, students will attend a 1-hour seminar on recent research completed in the vision sciences. Students will also attend a 1 hour discussion of a recent publication in the field (reflecting a fundamental idea or a controversy of competing ideas or empirical evidence), that will form that basis of critical discussion. The choice of issues to be discussed will be determined at the start of the subject.</p>"
