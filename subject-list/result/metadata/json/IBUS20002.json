    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces students to the challenges of managing and working in the contemporary global economy. To compete globally, businesses and managers need to understand the economic, social and political frameworks that support cross-border commerce. This subject explores the nature of country differences and how they impact and impede business choices and business risk. This subject analyses the strategies firms develop to compete internationally, focusing on how managers assess country risk, plan market entry strategies, structure their internal and external relations, and position themselves in an increasingly competitive global environment. New challenges for managers are considered, including technological innovation, environmental and ethical issues.</p>"
