    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject covers the principles and approaches to management in specific areas of practice across the lifespan (paediatric, women's and men's health and aged care). Theory on the development of motor skills from infancy to adulthood and its preservation through to end of life will be covered. The influence of pathology on the physical, social and emotional health and the role of the physiotherapist within the framework of contemporary theories of health maintenance through the lifespan will be explored.</p>"
