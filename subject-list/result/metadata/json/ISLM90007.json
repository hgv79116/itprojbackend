        "<p>How should we understand current affairs in the Middle East and South Asia, with particular reference to the intersection of religion (Islam) and politics? This subject surveys a number of movements, organisations, parties, and political issues in the Middle East and South Asia, drawing on case studies to explore key issues in the contemporary politics of both regions. Particular attention is paid to the relationship between Islam and violence, state formation, democracy, alliance-building, and human rights.</p>",
        "<p>With reference to the Middle East, the subject focuses on Muslim-majority states; in South Asia, it also considers Muslim-minority states. Beyond Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India, the course concludes with a consideration of Australian responses to states and populations with 'Islamic' or 'Islamist' orientations. What links Australia to Muslims in the modern Middle East, South Asia, and indeed the wider world?</p>"
