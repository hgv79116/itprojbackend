    "overview": [
        "<p>The Media and Communications Project provides students with an opportunity to conduct an extensive analysis of any form of media output, theoretical framework, institutional structure, or mode of reception. Students will deploy, and reflect upon their selected method of analysis and present their findings in a written report. They will be offered guidance throughout the process of conceiving, designing, executing and writing their report. The final written project should aim to produce a critical evaluation of the topic with reference to relevant positions of theory and debate, the methods and methodology deployed, as well as their own research practice. On completion of this subject, students will have gained critical insight into their chosen topic, as well as a deeper understanding of the processes, stages and methodological requirements for undertaking successful research in the field of Media and Communications. Students will also be asked to give an assessed poster presentation of their work, a format that is widely used by professionals and at academic conferences.</p>"
