        "<p>This capstone subject provides the opportunity for students to prepare for professional careers that will integrate their knowledge across the sub-disciplines of accounting (which may include financial accounting, management accounting, auditing and accounting information systems) by examining actual case studies and current events that cross sub-discipline boundaries. Students will draw on the knowledge, understanding and skills acquired in their coursework program to conduct research, develop findings, make recommendations and complete an in-depth investigation into an accounting topic of interest. The subject is application-oriented with a focus on group-based activities and developing written and oral communications skills expected by employers and clients and that are essential to a successful professional career.</p>"
