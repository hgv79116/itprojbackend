        "<p>The Victorian 7 \u2013 10 Biological Sciences Curriculum will be the content focus for this subject. This subject explores the content and pedagogical content knowledge of practical work and investigations. Participants will learn effective teaching methods for engaging students in science including the importance of practical work and demonstrations and utilising multiple modes of representation to enhance learning. Biological Science contexts will be the focus of this subject as participants review the use of commonly used apparatus, designing experiments and laboratory safety.</p>",
        "<p>Demonstrations, experiments and learning activities (including digital technology) will be shared and critically evaluated in order to build an understanding of how practical work can best be incorporated into the science classroom to enhance learning. Frameworks for planning units of work in science which provide differentiation of knowledge, skills, understanding and assessment will be reviewed. This subject will provide participants with a range of practical teaching tasks that are complemented by theory.</p>"
