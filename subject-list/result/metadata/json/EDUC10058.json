    "overview": [
        "<p>Using popular musical instruments, such as guitars, keyboards, drums and ukuleles, students, in small groups, will prepare a short informal \u2018pop\u2019 music performance of their chosen repertoire. No previous musical experience is required. The subject emphasises the important social aspects of music-making. Throughout the process of practical music making and rehearsals we will consider the significance of music for young people playing in bands for creative expression and in shaping personal and social identities. Included in this will be a real-world or virtual site visit to a live music venue or community event and short informal, in-class, small-group music performances. Throughout the subject, students will reflect on all these experiences through a reflective journal.</p>"
