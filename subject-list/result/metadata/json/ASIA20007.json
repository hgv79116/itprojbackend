        "<p>This subject examines human rights issues in Asia and the Middle East. The impact of Confucianism, Buddhism, Islam and other traditions on the shaping of human rights discourse in various Asian and Middle Eastern contexts will be assessed. So, too, will the impact of legal, institutional and politico-economic factors.</p>",
        "<p>Students will be encouraged to investigate case studies drawn from a variety of country contexts focused on pro-democracy movements, activism against political repression, religious and ethnic discrimination, advocacy for social and civil rights, and resistance to patriarchal systems. The diverse ideas put forward by Asian and Middle Eastern human rights thinkers will be evaluated as part of an ongoing debate about the dynamic and contested nature of human rights discourse in the modern world.</p>"
