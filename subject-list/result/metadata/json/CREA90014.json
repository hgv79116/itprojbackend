        "<p>This <em>online</em> subject provides students with the opportunity to apply key principles in objectivist research within the field of creative arts therapies. Students will learn about the most common objectivist research designs applied within the field and explore the quantitative methods associated with each through detailed examples of specific projects. This subject deepens understandings about objectivist research through direct examples from the literature with key skills being developed and assessed.</p>",
        "<p>Students will devise a creative arts therapy theory or practice research project that generates objectivist data; systematically review and critique literature that identifies research needs and knowledge gaps; apply an understanding of objectivist research through appropriate research design and plan a minor research project in creative arts therapy.</p>"
