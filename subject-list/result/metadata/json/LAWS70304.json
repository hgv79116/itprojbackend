    "overview": [
        "<p>International investment law regulates the entry and operation of foreign investment and is one of the fastest-growing fields of public international law. This subject begins by tracing the historical, political and economic causes for the protection of foreign investment across custom, bilateral and regional investment treaties. It then focuses on the unique system of dispute resolution in this field, which gives private (foreign) actors the right to pursue claims for damages against states. This subject also evaluates the impact of investment law across a range of core values, including public health, environmental regulation and the protection of human rights.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Nature, evolution and context of international investment law</li><li>Overview of bilateral investment treaties (BITs), the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Energy Charter Treaty and parts of the World Trade Organization (WTO)</li><li>Scope of protection: definition of \u2018investor\u2019 and \u2018investment\u2018</li><li>Relative obligations of non-discrimination: most-favored-nation (MFN) and national treatment</li><li>Obligation to accord foreign investors \u2018fair and equitable treatment\u2018</li><li>Expropriation and the quantification of compensation</li><li>Arbitration under the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) Convention</li></ul>"
