    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will focus on how both qualitative and quantitative aspects of marketing research can help managers address substantive marketing problems including: market segmentation, targeting and positioning, estimating market potential, forecasting demand, developing advertising and pricing, and introducing new products<em>. </em>The subject uses a combination of lectures, case discussions, and exercises to develop a better understanding of the process of marketing research. An important aspect of the subject involves getting hands-on experience with marketing research problems through a field project. This project will require students to integrate everything that they have learned to conduct an actual research project from problem definition through a final report and presentation.</p>"
