    "overview": [
        "<p><span>The aim of the capstone project is to deliver to the student a practical experience in a health and medical research work setting. The focus is on the application of knowledge and skills learnt during the core and elective coursework subjects. In this subject, students will learn to address the types of challenges that the practising biostatistician and their collaborator(s) typically face.</span></p>",
        "<p><span>The statistical analysis of real data almost always requires compromises, since no single method is always guaranteed to be superior and more than one approach may be reasonable. Students will gain experience in applied, biostatistical work. This will require an iterative approach, involving refinement of the research question, planning and conducting statistical analyses, and presenting and discussing results and conclusions in close collaboration with subject-matter experts.</span></p>",
        "<p><span>Effective communication with subject-matter experts is an important part of the biostatistician\u2019s role in the workplace and, therefore, of the capstone project. Under the guidance of a biostatistical supervisor, students have the opportunity to work with subject-matter experts to apply appropriate statistical methods to answer proposed research questions. Students will give an oral presentation describing their methods and results, and provide a written report.</span></p>",
        "<p><span>In this research project the student has the option for breadth or depth: two distinct research projects or one larger project with multiple challenges. Students must conduct their research in one semester. The alternative research project, POPH90288/POPH90289 is identical but spread over two consecutive semesters, whereas POPH90149 is limited in scope, ie less breadth and depth.</span></p>"
