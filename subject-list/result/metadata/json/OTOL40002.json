    "overview": [
        "<p>The proposed subject requires students to attend weekly departmental scientific seminars, and a subset of lectures in Anatomy &amp; Physiology (ANAT90004). Assessment will be based on a written report and an oral presentation. Students will be required to provide a 3000-word report reviewing the scientific literature relevant to their chosen area of research, and an oral presentation will be made on the critical analysis of a journal paper. The proposed format provides students with an introduction to the anatomy and physiology of the auditory system, as well as experience in the interpretation, critical analysis and presentation of scientific data. These skills are pertinent to their training in the communication and interpretation of scientific literature and research, and provide students with a sound basis on which to undertake the lab-based research component of the Honours year.</p>"
