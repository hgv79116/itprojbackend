    "overview": [
        "<p>In this course students learn about a selection of European cuisines and how they have been plated up for consumption in Melbourne. Food and wine are often used to support national and regional identity. In the first part of this course, students will consider the relationship between gastronomy and identity. Students will be introduced to a range of key culinary concepts and practices and the way we talk about them. Through analysis of some of the key features of French, Italian and Spanish cuisines, students will consider how these countries' culinary profiles speak to wider socio-political issues such as authenticity, food and space, cultural practices and the history of food and wine.</p>",
        "<p>In the second part of this course, students will consider issues of \"authenticity\" in the way cuisines are plated up for consumption in Melbourne. This will require students to interrogate their assumptions and expectations about European foods and wines and to reflect on their personal experience of the \"taste\" of Europe.</p>"
