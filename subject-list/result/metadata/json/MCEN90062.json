    "overview": [
        "<p>Students will develop an understanding of phase equilibria and transformations. Fundamental concepts in crystallography will be covered. Materials characterisation including phase analysis such as XRD and microstructure analysis including electron microscopy will be described. Students will be introduced to topics covering the mechanisms of corrosion and approaches to prevent it. Discussions on materials processing including casting, forging, extrusion, and heat treatment will be covered. Fabrication technologies including joining, welding, machining and additive manufacturing are described. Materials modelling including Integrated Computational Materials Engineering will be taught. Finally, students will be introduced to materials selection, design and safety.</p>"
