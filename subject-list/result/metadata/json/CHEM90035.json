        "<p>This subject is part of a sequence of four parts (or five parts for part-time) taken in successive semesters that together constitute the 125-point research project offered through the Master of Science (Chemistry).</p>",
        "<p>The research project involves undertaking experimental and/or theoretical research in an area currently relevant to one of the research groups in the School of Chemistry. The subject will enable students to develop the process and practice of chemical research; increase the student's knowledge and understanding of chemical science; encourage the development of individual investigative skills, critical thought and the ability to evaluate information and to analyse experimental data; and ensure that students receive essential training in laboratory safety procedures.</p>"
