        "<p>Randomness is inherent in biological data and the analysis of data arising in both Bioinformatics and Biostatistics requires knowledge of sophisticated probability models and statistical techniques. This subject develops the underlying probability theory that is necessary to understand these models and techniques. Computer packages are used for numerical calculations but no programming skills are required. Elements of Probability will be co-taught with MAST20006 Probability for Statistics.</p>"
