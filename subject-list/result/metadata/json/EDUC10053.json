        "<p>How can you build confidence and develop connections with your peers through drama, comedy, and improvisation? In this subject, students will study practical ways of engaging with improvisation in drama and theatre and explore how doing so can contribute towards positive personal development and socialisation outcomes in a range of community and learning settings. Students will learn how improvisation can develop skills such as empathy, collaboration, critical thinking, and communication. In class students will take part in a range of improvisational activities and conduct research based on the work of leading practitioners past and present. Students do not need existing experience in the arts.</p>"
