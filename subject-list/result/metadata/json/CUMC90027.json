        "<p>In this subject, students explore issues relating to the preservation of culture that is held beyond large collecting institutions.  Students will develop an understanding of how the epistemology of cultural maintenance manifests in a range of societal and cultural practices. Students engage with issues relating to context, disruption, authenticity, legal standing, development, reinvention, identity and minority status. Students will understand how a broad intellectual engagement and the promotion of ideas and interests operate to produce outcomes for people who may not be in a position to engage with large collecting institutions.</p>"
