    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces performance, stability and control of a range of aerospace vehicles. It will cover the modelling of aerospace physical systems as ordinary differential equations, and then introduce mathematical techniques to analyse and control their behaviour.</p>",
        "<p> <br/>The topics covered in this subject include:</p>",
        "<p>\u2022 The fundamentals of flight dynamics for flight vehicles in the atmosphere. This will describe the flight dynamic models and stability of flight vehicles.<br/>\u2022 The fundamentals of spacecraft dynamics for six degree of freedom space vehicles. This will describe basic orbital mechanics and the translation and rotation of rigid bodies.<br/>\u2022 Other key topics that will be considered are control and estimation methods to stabilize flight and orbital vehicles, an introduction to inertial navigation systems and vertical take-off and landing aircraft models.</p>",
        "<p>MATLAB will be used throughout the course to complement the presented concepts.</p>"
