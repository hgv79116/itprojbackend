        "<p>In Design for Innovation students have the opportunity to rethink and redesign how the law operates and engages with clients and the community by placing the user at the centre of the design process.</p>",
        "<p>Design is the process of creatively and strategically solving problems. Human\u2010centred design maps out the user\u2019s journey to find the most challenging problems, placing the people with the problems at the centre of the solution. It has become a powerful tool to deploy in the pursuit of making better services and products. Its role in the legal sector is emerging and it is already making breakthroughs in the delivery of government services and private practice.</p>",
        "<p>This subject explores the principles of human\u2010centred design, including the collaborative process \u2013 empathising with users, ideation, prototyping and user\u2010testing. It is both theoretical and practical, providing students with ongoing tools and techniques to deploy in pursuit of solving problems and delivering better services. Challenging the traditional notion of \u2018lawyer as expert\u2019, it asks students to adopt a different, human\u2010centred and collaborative perspective on problem solving through design. Students will have the opportunity to work on real world issues relevant to their work place or practice interests.</p>",
        "<p>The lecturers in this subject combine years of experience in this area, sharing a commitment to solving complex legal problems using human\u2010centred design.</p>"
