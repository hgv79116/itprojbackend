    "overview": [
        "<p>Agriculture is an important part of the Australian economy and vital for rural communities.  In this subject, students will explore the development of agriculture in Australia and globally. Issues around world food supply and demand, the natural and market conditions that determine the nature of agricultural activity in Australia, along with the key elements of farming and farm businesses that determine how they perform will be studied.  The major livestock (sheep, beef and dairy) along with field and horticultural crops will be covered.  The subject will be taught using a combination of lectures, workshops and field trips. </p>",
        "<p>This subject is intended for students who have not previously studied agriculture in the Australian context.   </p>"
