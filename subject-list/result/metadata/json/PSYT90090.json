This unit is intended to provide an overview of broad principles of psychodynamic psychotherapy and their application to psychiatric assessment, intervention and management of a range of psychiatric conditions.</p>",
        "<p> </p>",
        "<p>This unit will cover the skills and knowledge required as mandated Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) training in supportive psychotherapy and in managing the therapeutic alliance. The unit will also assist in tackling the long psychotherapy training case which is mandated RANZCP training.</p>",
        "<p> </p>",
        "<p>The course will have sessions on psychodynamic theory starting with Freud, Klein and Winnicott (object relations) and move to contemporary and integrative developments such as mentalisation based psychodynamic psychotherapy thus linking with infant development and attachment theory.</p>",
        "<p> </p>",
