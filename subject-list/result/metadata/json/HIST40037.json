    "overview": [
        "<p>It is a commonplace that we live in globalised world. But what does this mean in theory and in practice? How did we get to this point? And how do we interpret the processes that underpin our global world? This subject examines the origins of the interconnected global paradigm from its origins in the mid-fifteenth century until the present day. It explores the structural changes that have shaped our experiences of, and interactions with, the world. It brings a rich historical perspective to some of the critical debates and challenges of the modern era.</p>"
