        "<p>In this subject, students will learn about the current advances in molecular science fields encompassed by the disciplines of biochemistry and molecular biology. Students will critique cutting edge research in depth, delving into the experimental evidence underpinning our understanding of the molecular world. The topics to be examined include regulation of gene expression, gene function and genomic manipulation protein behaviour in cellular applications, the dynamics of the living cell, and metabolic adaptation. </p>",
        "<p>Through written and oral tasks, students will become proficient in interpreting and synthesizing scientific knowledge and presenting conclusions, as well as writing critiques and recommendations for a range of audiences including, public organisations, industry and the general public.</p>"
