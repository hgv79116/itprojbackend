    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will give students a foundational understanding of the policy context in which they live and practice, and develop their capacity to critically read, analyse and evaluate the impact of policy in everyday lives. It will give an overview of the historical development of social policy and engage students in critical debates about the systems and policy solutions produced. It will introduce key concepts and intellectual debates in contemporary social policy and provide a framework for policy analysis that can be used in critical policy assessment. The role of social workers in social policy development and advocacy will be explored. Students will develop an increased awareness of the influence of the broader policy environment and develop the capacity to advocate for change in their work with individuals, groups and communities.</p>"
