    "overview": [
        "<p>The subject examines in-depth the observation, analysis and prediction of wind-generated waves in the open ocean, in shelf seas, and in coastal regions. It also provides an introduction to wave and hydrodynamics modelling as a support for engineering applications. It provides a multi-disciplinary overview of problems by combining cutting-edge research in Maritime and Coastal Engineering and industry applications. The subject will provide students with a solid grounding in wave physics that is essential to evaluate the environmental impact on design and operation of marine structures.</p>",
        "<p>Topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Linear wave theory;</li><li>Second-order wave theory</li><li>Wave Spectrum;</li><li>Tides;</li><li>Wave Measurements;</li><li>Near-shore processes;</li><li>Wave statistics;</li><li>Hydrodynamics and wave modelling;</li></ul>"
