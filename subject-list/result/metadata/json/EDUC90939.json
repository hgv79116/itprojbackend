        "<p>This subject examines the interpretation and use of assessment data in a range of settings from Early Childhood to Tertiary. Various approaches to the interpretation of assessment data are examined, including criterion and standards referenced methods, with an emphasis on the reliability of data and the improvement of assessment processes. The valid use of assessment data to improve learning at individual, school, and system level are explored, as well as processes and practices which support such uses.</p>"
