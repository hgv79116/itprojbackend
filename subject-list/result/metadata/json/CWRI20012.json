    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject explores how creative writing practice encounters identity and alterity. Students will engage with the politics of representation through critical theory, intertextual reflexivity and deconstruction of inherited categories of self and other. It addresses the authority of writing and the responsibilities of ethical representation in creative practice. Students will analyse, discuss and critique a variety of textual representations, before applying these ethical considerations and creative methods to their own writing. The subject will be delivered through a series of lectures and creative practice workshops, which focus on developing ethical and engaging writing.</p>"
