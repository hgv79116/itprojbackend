Detailed character and text work with integrated physical and vocal choices allow the student to extend their transformational abilities in support of the performance projects for the semester.</p>",
        "<p>Students continue to apply an autonomous practice addressing specific technical and creative goals in consultation with staff, to build fitness, resilience and self-confidence as a performer. Through training tasks and exercises, students integrate their acting, vocal and physical skills.</p>"
