    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject aims to consolidate and enhance the overall language competencies that students have previously acquired in reading, writing, listening and speaking. Students will be introduced to the rich history and diversity of the Francophonie, and invited to explore a series of culturally and linguistically diverse Francophone communities around the world. Through their research projects, the weekly reading, discussions and analysis of a wide range of authentic materials (such as short stories, graphic novels, articles, songs, documentaries, films, interviews, news clips, etc.), students will develop effective and appropriate learning and research strategies such that they become independent and competent users of French.</p>"
