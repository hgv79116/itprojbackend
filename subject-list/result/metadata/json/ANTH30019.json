        "<p>What makes innovation successful? How are innovative products or processes able to capture our imagination and desires? Can technology offer sustainable solutions for a world on the brink of ecological and social catastrophes? What are the social costs of innovation? This subject allows students to explore first-hand the social dynamics that make innovation possible. In partnership with startups, companies, or public sector innovators, students will conduct hands-on research to understand how new technologies, including robots or apps, can help solve social or business challenges. Students who take this subject will be introduced to design-thinking and asked to transform their observations and critiques into advice for building new solutions. Through its participatory approach, this subject allows students to become active contributors in the design process and build their creativity and research skills in the job market.</p>"
