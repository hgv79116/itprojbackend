    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject develops knowledge and understanding of systems for regulating body function, and physiological and behavioural processes that are utilised by animals in response to environmental challenges. This basis will allow students to evaluate and assess animal welfare and ethical issues that confront livestock production and amenity use of animals in society. The subject will also develop knowledge in adaptation, preference testing, cognition, and short and long-term biological responses.</p>",
        "<p>Specific topics covered include;</p>",
        "<ul><li>The current debate about animal usage and animal welfare</li><li>Systems regulating the body (homeostasis, motivation and control systems, and development of regulatory systems)</li><li>Limits to adaptation (stimulation, tolerance and coping, variation in adaptation)</li><li>Stress and welfare (Selye\u2019s concept of stress and refinements to the concept, coping and fitness, definition of welfare and its assessment)</li><li>Assessing welfare using short-term and long-term biological responses</li><li>Assessing welfare using preference testing</li><li>Assessing welfare by studying cognitive skills</li><li>Ethical problems concerning welfare</li><li>Welfare issues in agriculture and the general community; and codes of practice for the welfare of livestock and welfare solutions</li></ul>"
