    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject examines the place of international institutions within the international legal order, considering their structure, normative underpinnings, and activities. It focuses on inter- governmental organisations but also considers non-governmental organisations and the role of civil society and national governments in both types of institution. It considers how international institutions reflect conflicting notions of fragmentation and unity in international law. Principal topics to be covered include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>the complex role of international institutions in the development of international law and global governance;</li><li>introduction to specialised international institutions in Geneva and elsewhere including their history, trends in their mission, influence and importance, recent developments, and reform proposals;</li><li>the theory surrounding fragmentation of international law, including the proliferation of institutions and dispute settlement tribunals and the proliferation of substantive laws;</li><li>inter-organisational cooperation, coordination and conflict in areas such as trade, human rights, the laws of war, and development; and</li><li>participation and representation in international institutions by governments, business, civil society and secretariat staff.</li></ul>",
        "<p>The class will have the opportunity to hear from and interact with expert interlocutors on-site at a diverse range of governmental, intergovernmental, non-governmental and private entities.</p>"
