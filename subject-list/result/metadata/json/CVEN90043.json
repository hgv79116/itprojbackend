    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides an overview of a wide range of issues relating to infrastructure engineering, with a particular focus on the environmental, economic and social implications of engineering projects. Students will gain a holistic understanding of the complexities of \u2013 and potential trade-offs in \u2013 decision-making, including considerations of social equity, quality of life and wellbeing, and assessment of economic and environmental impacts. Students will learn about the influential role that infrastructure plays in shaping a society, and the effects both short-term and long-term. Students will also learn to apply various methods to evaluate infrastructure projects from a sustainability perspective. Lectures will be complemented by examples or case studies, assigned tasks and a group project in order to consolidate and apply learnings. Throughout the term, students will be supported to enhance their research skills as well as their oral and written communication skills.</p>",
        "<p>This subject is part of a trio of subjects that consider different aspects of infrastructure projects. Engineering Site Characterisation explores how to determine the character of a site for an infrastructure project. Sustainable Infrastructure Engineering examines how a project relates to the broader social, economic, and environmental context. Engineering Project Implementation concentrates on the operational aspects of implementing a project.</p>"
