    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject focuses on one of the tangible outcomes of the political process, with public policy often at the centre of contests for and over political power. Public policy has traditionally been designed and implemented by governments but increasingly market actors, non-government organisations, policy communities and networks are key actors, while many policy problems are global issues and beyond the purview of a single national government. Within governments, political advisors, lobbyists and interest groups are arguably usurping the influence of public servants, while politicians are answerable through the media and to the party and cabinet rooms, and less so to the parliament. Finally, the \u2018public\u2019 is not a homogenous group and certain forms of action privilege some groups over others.</p>",
        "<p>Using cases of both innovative and failed policies, this subject considers how problems are effectively framed and how ideas and evidence can be practically applied to policy solutions. The aim of this subject is to provide a professional grounding for future policy officers and analysts, political advisors and government relations practitioners as well as preparing students for undertaking internships.<br/><br/></p>"
