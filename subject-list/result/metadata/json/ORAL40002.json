        "<p>This subject offers students the opportunity to gain an understanding and practical experience in oral health research in their own individually designed and supervised research project. Students are required to complete a research project and to produce a written thesis under the guidance of their supervisor(s).</p>",
        "<p>Research projects will be offered in a wide variety of oral health research areas allowing students to choose a topic that interests them.</p>",
        "<p>Students will be enrolled in a combination of research project subjects (4A and 4B) to ensure they complete a 75 point research project by the end of their course.</p>"
