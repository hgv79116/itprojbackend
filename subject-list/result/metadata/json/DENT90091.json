    "overview": [
        "<p>Following on from Oral Medicine 1, this subject focuses on developing introductory learnings to intermediate knowledge in the oral medicine field in preparation before their final year of speciality practice. The subject continues to build students\u2019 understanding on the aetiology, pathogenesis, immunology and clinical aspects of oral medicine, specifically with regard to oral mucosal lesions, orofacial pain or temporomandibular dysfunction.</p>",
        "<p>Students\u2019 knowledge in oral pathology will be refined in this subject in order to diagnose and treat diseases of the oral mucosa and oro-facial pain. Through participation in regular seminars and review meetings, they will continue to develop their intermediate knowledge as a specialist. They will expand their competencies in recognising diseases and relevant risk factors, and further form their awareness of the full range of clinical treatment services in oral medicine. They will build inter-disciplinary relationships across the environment of medical, dental, allied health professionals.</p>",
        "<p>The clinical component of the subject will provide supervised opportunities for students to understand the process of managing patients with oral mucosal disorders, oral manifestations of systemic disease and the assessment and treatment of patients with oro-facial pain during the clinical component of the subject. Assessment of clinical performance will include written paper and oral examinations on both clinical skills, and developed understandings of histological diagnosis and patient management. Students will be required to pass all sections (clinical, laboratory and theory) of this subject.</p>",
        "<p>Students will partake in weekly teaching sessions of Doctor of Dental Surgery students.</p>"
