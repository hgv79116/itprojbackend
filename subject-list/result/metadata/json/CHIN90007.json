    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will enable students to undertake approximately 170 hours of professional work experience at an industry partner\u2019s premise. Students should only be enrolled in the subject if they have secured professional work placement which has been approved by the Subject Coordinator. Students will be placed in an organisation which either analyses or formulates and implements programs, policies, or commercial activities in relation to contemporary Chinese societies. The range of organisations relevant to the internship is broad: international organisations, for-profit companies, government departments, non-governmental organisations (including church-based aid agencies), academic and analytical think tanks. Interns will work under the supervision and guidance of a senior manager within these organisations. Students will be provided with advice by the Subject Coordinator on potential organisations to contact, but will also be required to use their own networks; their choice will then need to be ratified by the Subject Coordinator. Students will carry out research or analytical exercises of relevance to the organisation\u2019s Chinese societies-related work. Students will also observe the structure, culture and policy environment of the organisation and develop advanced analytical, research and report-writing skills, and interpersonal skills. Students completing this subject should expect to acquire significant insight into the complexities of Chinese societies and associated programmatic activities. During the internship an academic supervisor will advise them. If primary research is carried out during the internship, ethics approval is the responsibility of the host organisation.</p>"
