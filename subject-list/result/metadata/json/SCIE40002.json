    "overview": [
        "<p>The Science Research Project (Advanced) is an individual program of supervised research in which the student, in consultation with a supervisor, contributes to the design, execution and presentation of a research project. The project may be \u2018stand-alone\u2019 or part of a larger research program being undertaken by the supervisor. The specific details of the project, including its scope and the compilation, analysis and presentation of the results, are negotiated with the supervisor and, as appropriate, the Science Research Project (Advanced) Coordinator(s). Students should approach a potential supervisor within a discipline area that is aligned to their research interests. Students will receive feedback on their progress through ongoing consultation with their supervisor.</p>",
        "<p>This subject provides an opportunity for students to gain first-hand experience of scientific research. Undertaking the Science Research Project (Advanced) provides invaluable insights for students considering a career in scientific research.</p>"
