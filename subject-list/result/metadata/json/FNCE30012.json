    "overview": [
        "<p>Technology has been transforming the financial industry, with the potential to disrupt traditional industry structure and practice. The subject is organised around a number of real\u2010world issues, in order to introduce fundamental underlying economic (including money, moral hazard, property rights and bank runs) and psychological (including engagement, trust and privacy) problems, and how technology could provide transformative solutions to those problems (e.g., big data, distributed ledgers, artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing). Cases will illustrate the core concepts. The emphasis is on foundations, so students will be able to apply the learned concepts in novel situations.</p>"
