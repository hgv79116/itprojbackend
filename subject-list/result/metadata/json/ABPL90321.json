    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides insight into the design briefing process for a range of facilities, with a specific focus on learning and health environments. Key issues addressed include how to effectively engage with users/occupants of buildings, collect data about their organisational objectives, activities and spatial requirements, and strategically link such information to the work of architects and other design consultants.</p>",
        "<p>The subject examines evidence-based design, effective planning processes that include stakeholder engagement and consultation, change management, spatial literacy, and workplace cultures and pedagogies. Participants will develop skills associated with developing strategic briefs that translate organisational objectives and patterns of activity into spatial requirements, including affinity and relationship diagrams.</p>"
