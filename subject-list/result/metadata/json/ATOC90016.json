    "overview": [
        "<p>Extreme weather and climate events have large impacts on people and the environment. It is vital that these events are well predicted on weather forecasting timescales to limit the damages they cause. It is also important that the characteristics of these events in a changing climate are well understood so that we can be prepared for future climate extremes. This course will focus on how weather and climate extremes are characterised locally and internationally, how they have changed and how they will change under global warming. The processes that lead to these events and how they are forecast will also be explained. Statistical techniques for analysing extremes will be introduced. This course will also include discussion of how extremes are communicated in terms of mitigating risks for forecast events.</p>"
