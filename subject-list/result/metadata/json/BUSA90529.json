        "<p>The purpose of this subject is to study and practice topics on developing an entrepreneurial venture from an idea through to its first \u2018minimum viable product\u2019 in the market, and first customer.</p>",
        "<p>The subject closely examines how entrepreneurial ventures are established; the building of attributes and skills of successful entrepreneurs; how product-market fit is established through business models; development of financial models in entrepreneurial ventures; how and with what outcomes meso-level interfacing between the entrepreneur and market incumbents exists; and deployment of a value-adding product in the market.</p>",
        "<p>This subject presents some of the key frameworks and tools needed by entrepreneurs and is for anyone who has an interest in understanding entrepreneurship as either potential founders, those looking to intrapreneurship in large organisations, or those looking to work with entrepreneurs in one way or another. The subject uses a combination of theory building and key entrepreneurial model exploration and intensive \u2018bootcamp\u2019 approach, similar to entrepreneurial bootcamps in practice, to build knowledge and skills in the area, recognising that these are transferable and useful to many students will either start or work for non-traditional organisations.</p>"
