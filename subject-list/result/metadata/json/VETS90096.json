        "<p>This subject is composed of 23 weeks of Core and Track clinical rotations undertaken within the University Veterinary Hospital and at external locations, and 21 weeks of clinical extramural placements. Students also participate in the Capstone activities at the conclusion of their clinical training and assessment tasks.</p>",
        "<p>This subject includes training in clinical disciplines that include anesthesiology, anatomical pathology, clinical pathology, conservation and Wildlife medicine, diagnostic imaging, equine medicine and surgery, production animal medicine and surgery, shelter medicine and surgery, small animal emergency and critical care, small animal medicine and surgery and veterinary public health/epidemiology.</p>",

Students may commence these extramural placements immediately after achieving passes in all DVM 3 level subjects.</p>",
        "<p>After completion of the 42 weeks of clinical training, the subject concludes with a Capstone series of lectures and workshops which review topics that prepare students for transition to the workplace and their veterinary professional careers.</p>"
