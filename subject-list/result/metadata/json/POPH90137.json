    "overview": [
        "<p>The Comprehensive Rural Health Project (CRHP) in Jamkhed, India has won global acclaim and provided inspiration for the seminal Declaration of Alma Ata (1978). It remains one of the world\u2019s most influential and innovative comprehensive community health and development programs. In this 3 week residential subject, students will learn about the Jamkhed Model while living in the resource-poor context of central Maharashtra, India. Students will engage with and critically analyse the Jamkhed approach to community health and development via: field visits to villages and project sites; seminars and discussions with project staff, lay volunteers, local health and development professionals and researchers; and interactive observations and teaching with university staff.</p>",
        "<p>Students of this subject will gain a thorough understanding of the context and history of comprehensive primary health care as a movement, and its applications within the Indian context. Students will acquire detailed knowledge of how the CRHP has applied a community-based, integrated multi-sectoral action, utilising a deep understanding of local culture and needs to address a wide range of issues. These include mortality and morbidity, poverty, gender inequity, and water and sanitation. Students will learn how to apply these principles in the design of programs seeking to address a variety of global health problems and contexts.
