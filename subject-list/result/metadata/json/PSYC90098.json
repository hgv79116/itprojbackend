        "<p>Mind, Brain &amp; Behaviour 2 focuses on the development of the individual and their interaction with their environment and considers what the consequences are, both when this interaction proceeds smoothly and when it does not proceed smoothly.</p>",
        "<p>The subject comprises five core topic areas: Human Development; Social Psychology; Personality Psychology; Clinical Psychology; and Quantitative Psychological Research Methods. In presenting these topics, the subject aims to provide students with knowledge of major theories, historical trends and empirical findings.</p>",
        "<p>An understanding of some basic issues in human development is complemented with an examination of the nature and development of personality and human interaction in social groups and cultural settings. </p>",
        "<p>Moreover, the subject provides opportunity for students to develop and apply a range of fundamental skills in areas of critical thinking, psychological research methods, and communication of psychological knowledge.  </p>",
        "<p>A common research-centred framework is adopted and the statistical tools that support this framework are introduced and developed as an integral part of the course.</p>"
