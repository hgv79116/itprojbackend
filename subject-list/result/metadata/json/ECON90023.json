    "overview": [
        "<p>The subject will cover development economics. The topics covered may include: economic growth theory, including models in which growth is endogenous; measurement of poverty and inequality; tests of the efficiency of labour and credit markets; consumption smoothing; micro-credit schemes; and demographic issues.</p>",
        "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This subject studies microeconomic conditions in developing countries. It aims to go beyond a mere description of economic conditions in these parts of the world. The emphasis is on rigorous theoretical economic modelling of phenomena observed in developing countries. Substantial attention will also be paid to the testing of the theories using real world data. Students are thus expected to have some econometric knowledge.</p>"
