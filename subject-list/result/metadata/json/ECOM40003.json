    "overview": [
        "<p>Decision making in central banks, consulting firms, and other institutions relies on advanced empirical analyses of economic data. This subject provides a cutting-edge econometric methodology for empirical macroeconomic research. The focus is put on modelling unit-root nonstationary processes that describe many economic time series well. Applications of the considered econometric techniques include forecasting and nowcasting macroeconomic variables including using big data, estimating the effects of monetary policy, as well as modelling of trend inflation. Topics in Climate Change include forecasting CO2 emissions for the 21st century and modelling long-run trends in global temperatures. Particular attention is paid to developing programming skills that allow for performing rigorous applied macroeconomic research in R.</p>"
