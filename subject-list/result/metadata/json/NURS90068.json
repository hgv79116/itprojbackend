The subject will concentrate on the use of diagnostic investigations to aid patient / client assessment and diagnosis. The focus of the subject will be on the interpretation of diagnostic results in complex and uncertain situations. Students will have the option of selecting relevant assessment and diagnostic approaches and/or tools for their own area of specialisation. These topics include cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, cognitive, and developmental, abdominal, alimentary, and nutritional, genitourinary, musculoskeletal integument and psychosocial assessment. In addition, Students will also address the importance of consultation with other clinicians within multidisciplinary teams.</p>",
        "<p>The subject will provide students with strategies to assist them to develop advanced health assessment skills. On campus tutorials and workshops, reading and resource material will be provided to assist students to develop the necessary knowledge and skills for advanced health examination and patient assessment. Students will use clinical supervisors in their practice environment to support their learning and assess their performance, in particular development of practical assessment skills, use of diagnostic tests and interpret findings in relation to undertaking a physical health assessment.</p>"
