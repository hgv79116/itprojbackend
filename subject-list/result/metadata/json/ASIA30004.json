        "<p>Corruption is widely considered to be a major obstacle to sustainable economic and social development in Asia. This subject examines the notion of corruption and the analytical frameworks that scholars, policy-makers and activists have used to understand it. It also analyses the nature, magnitude, causes, and consequences of corruption within the region focusing on a set of case studies related to matters such as economic growth, public service provision, the rule of law, and environmental protection. The subject concludes by evaluating alternative strategies for combating corruption within the region.</p>"
