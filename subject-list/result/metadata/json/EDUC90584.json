        "<p>Building on the work done in Learning &amp; Teaching Contexts 1, participants will consider system and school-level responses to students\u2019 needs in a context of equity, inclusion and social justice, with a focus on the role of policy in guiding teacher practice, curriculum design and professional relationships. They will investigate the process of change in schools, with a particular focus on creating the conditions for improvement in student outcomes.</p>",
        "<p>This subject provides an opportunity for participants to develop a deep understanding of two key topics: Indigenous Education and Youth Transitions. Through exploration of the Indigenous Education topic, participants will develop a broad knowledge and understanding of the impact of culture, cultural identity and linguistic background on the education of students from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander backgrounds as well as respect for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island histories, cultures and languages, and the implications of this understanding for their own practice. Participants will also explore the nature of youth transitions in Australia, the patterns and trends of transition amongst different cohorts of students, and the implications for their schools.</p>"
