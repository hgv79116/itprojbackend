    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject canvasses 11 of the most challenging current questions in comparative constitutional law. It does so from a global perspective, which appreciates the diversity of constitutional arrangements across the world while acknowledging their interconnections and their many shared problems. The issues on which the subject focusses in 2021 range across questions of method to problems of substance and will be explored both conceptually and empirically. Topics include, for example, comparative constitutional methods, constitutional identity, constitutional pluralism and constituent power. Each seminar is led by a comparative scholar affiliated with Melbourne Law School, drawing on the resources of one of the leading comparative constitutional law centres in the world.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics are likely to include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Comparative constitutional methods</li><li>Pluralism</li><li>The global south in comparative constitutional law</li><li>Constitutional interpretation</li><li>Constitutional amendment</li><li>Comparing federations</li><li>Constitutional repair after democratic decay</li><li>Environmental constitutionalism</li><li>Limitations on rights</li><li>Guarantor institutions</li><li>Global constitutionalism</li><li>Future directions</li></ul>",
        "<p>The subject is coordinated by Cheryl Saunders and Anna Dziedzic, who will ensure interlinkages between seminars and will draw the subject together in a final seminar on future directions. The subject should be of considerable interest to Australian and international students from all regions of the world.</p>"
