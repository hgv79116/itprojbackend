        "<p>This subject builds on the interdependence of vocal and physical work with character and performance.</p>",
        "<p>Students in Acting are introduced to acting methodologies for the exploration of character and text, including foundational work on script analysis and character study. Idiosyncratic physical and vocal habits further develop a functional, efficient and flexible performer\u2019s instrument. Students in Theatre explore ensemble devising techniques and are introduced to central ideas in collaborative practice through a range of workshops and projects.</p>",
        "<p>Students investigate physical mapping techniques to develop a vocabulary for the performer\u2019s relationship to space, weight, time, rhythm, energy and impulse. Improvisation, devising and text work build flexibility and confidence with making creative offers, developing students\u2019 imaginative alacrity.</p>",
        "<p>Through various practical activities, students will further develop their skills and capabilities in vocal and physical work with character and performance. In applying technical and conceptual skills to training tasks and exercises, students will extend their physical, vocal, performative, and collaborative abilities.</p>"
