    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject invites understanding of the heterogenous ground through which choreography as research takes place. Through a collaborative and constructive laboratory environment, students engage in choreographic practice and explore artistic identity in relation to the shifting roles of the choreographer.</p>",
        "<p>Workshopping the many possibilities opened by corporeal and conceptual engagements with contemporary movements, discourses, things, theories, technologies, histories, places and praxes choreography is understood as a form of lively address and an interdisciplinary practice.</p>",
        "<p>Students develop their working knowledge of dramaturgy and their capacities for observation, responsiveness and critical awareness in constructing self/peer review and feedback. This subject is delivered through intensive practical workshops, laboratory tasks, feedback sessions, seminars and tutorials.</p>"
