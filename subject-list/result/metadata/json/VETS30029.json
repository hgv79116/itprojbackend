        "<p>This subject takes a multi-disciplinary approach to the investigation of health and disease in domestic animals. Students will be introduced to the structural and functional organisational units of the body and to the fundamental principles of veterinary anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, pharmacology, general pathology and immunology. Students will gain a theoretical knowledge and practical laboratory skills that are fundamental to an appraisal of the health of domestic animals.</p>"
