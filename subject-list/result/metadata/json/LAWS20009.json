    "overview": [
        "<p>The preservation and protection of the environment is one of the defining issues of our time. It spans and traverses both the domestic and international spheres and raises important issues of justice and fairness. It inevitably raises pressing legal questions. There are multiple legal systems that regulate and influence how we relate to the environment, including constitutional and administrative law, property and private law, international environment law, human rights law and even international investment law.</p>",
        "<p>This subject offers an introduction to how law shapes and defines our relations to the environment, including issues of sustainability, democracy, environmental justice and global inequality. It brings together a number of areas of law, and invites students to consider legal principles, institutions and legal questions at the heart of environmental rights and responsibilities. The subject will draw on case studies in Australian, comparative and international law. It will invite students to explore the possibilities and limits of different areas of law in realising social and environmental objectives, the way that those areas of law are already implicated in environmental problems, and to consider how law may protect environmental rights and environmental justice in novel ways.</p>",
        "<p> </p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>The nature of environmental problems and their societal and legal dimensions;</li><li>The relationship between rights, responsibilities and the environment in theory; and practice, including principles and frameworks of environmental law;</li><li>The environment in international law, for example, in the context of world heritage protection, transnational environmental assessment and pollution, global commons, whaling, a crime of ecocide or climate change;</li><li>The emergence and principles of domestic and international environmental law;</li><li>Environmental human rights and the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment;</li><li>Environmental justice, intersectionality and global and domestic inequalities;</li><li>The roles and responsibilities of non-state actors in relation to environmental rights, including environmental advocates, businesses and transnational corporations</li><li>Indigenous peoples, environmental and land rights and Indigenous laws;</li><li>The \u2018rights of nature\u2019 and non-human environmental rights;</li><li>Climate change litigation;</li><li>Alternative forms of environmental politics such as civil disobedience, and their constitutional treatment.</li></ul>"
