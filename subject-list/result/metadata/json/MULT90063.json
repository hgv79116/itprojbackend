    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will introduce students to the world of quantum information technology, focusing on the fast developing area of quantum computing. The subject will cover basic principles of quantum logic operations in both digital and analogue approaches to quantum processors, through to quantum error correction and the implementation of quantum algorithms for real-world problems. In lab-based classes students will learn to use state-of-the-art quantum computer programing and simulation environments to complete a range of projects.</p>"
