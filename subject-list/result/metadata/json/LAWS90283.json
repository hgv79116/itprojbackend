    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject takes a deep dive into statelessness, a serious but little understood human rights issue affecting millions of people around the world, including in the Asia Pacific region. Key related concepts of citizenship, statelessness and legal identity will be discussed, as will the debate around the limits of State sovereignty when it comes to the right to nationality. The causes and consequences of statelessness will be unpacked, with a focus on the human impact of statelessness. We critically examine the international legal framework established to address statelessness, and we scrutinise past, present and possible future manifestations of statelessness with a view to understanding how these may be prevented or resolved.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics will include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Key concepts and definitions: citizenship, statelessness, and legal identity,</li><li>The right to belong? Ethical and Political Dimensions,</li><li>Causes, consequences and the human impact of statelessness,</li><li>The international legal framework governing statelessness,</li><li>The protection of stateless persons in a migratory context,</li><li>Solutions to statelessness: citizenship as the panacea?,</li><li>Contemporary and future problems of statelessness: including \u2018Citizenship stripping\u2019 and climate change and nationality,</li><li>International Development: Identity Management, Legal Identity and Human Rights.</li></ul>"
