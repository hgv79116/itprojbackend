    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject aims to give you theoretical frameworks, practical insights, and preliminary skills to work in your chosen profession in contexts where determining what problem to work on is an important complement to knowing how to solve that problem.</p>",
        "<p>You will develop these understandings, insights and skills by working on two projects.  In the first, they will work in multi-disciplinary teams on a strategically-important innovation challenge sponsored by an industry organisation. Through that project, you will learn the \u201cwhat and how\u201d of delivering innovation-like projects \u2013 understanding the relationship between your challenge and the organisation\u2019s strategy; designing, securing, and conducting interviews; analysing qualitative data to generate insights; ideation and creativity techniques to create value; stakeholder management; working in an intense team on an ambiguous problem; visual and oral communication.  In the second, you will develop the ability to apply to the same concepts to yourself \u2013 How will you know what you want and need?   How will you know if you need to change?  How will you innovate yourself as your interests, needs, and work world shift?   </p>",
        "<p>We aim for you and your team to own your project and your learning. </p>",
        "<p>Creating Innovative Professionals (CIP) and its companion subject, Creating Innovative Engineering ENGR90034 (CIE), are delivered by the University's Innovation Practice Program.
