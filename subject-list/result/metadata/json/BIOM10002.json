    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject examines the five core concepts in biology: evolution, structure &amp; function, regulation, transmission of information and interconnectedness. These biological concepts will first be introduced broadly, followed by a more focused exploration of how they apply in human health and disease. Specific diseases will be viewed through the lens of the central disciplines of Biomedical Science to elaborate on how the five core concepts relate to molecules and genes, cells and tissues, organs and systems; and individuals and populations of both humans and pathogens.</p>"
