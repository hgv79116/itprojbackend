    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject comprises clinical learning (general dentistry) in the Melbourne Dental Clinic (MDC), the Royal Dental Hospital of Melbourne, urban community health centres, specialist practice/hospital clinics and rural community health clinics. Students will engage in tasks that will demonstrate and further enhance their skills preparing them for the work environment in which they will participate and contribute to, on graduation as a dentist.</p>",
        "<p>This year-long subject is developed as a capstone experience with a practice based learning approach. The learning tasks will enhance students\u2019 capacity to apply theoretical knowledge gained in previous years of the course to \u201creal world\u201d situations. Students will integrate graduate capabilities with clinical skills that are required to practice as an independent health care professional. They will also develop skills in teamwork and communication with the wider health sector. The clinical practice sessions, especially at the community health centres, will allow students to reflect on emotional and practical issues of transition from the university learning environment to the world of independent clinical practice. They also provide the opportunity to link students to future employers. The intended learning outcomes are designed to engender the development of graduate attributes.</p>"
