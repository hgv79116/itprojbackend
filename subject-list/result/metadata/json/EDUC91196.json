    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject focuses on the implementation and completion of a self-study/action research project. During the subject, students will use a researcher\u2019s journal to document and scaffold their research process. Through a multimodal presentation, students will share their preliminary analysis with peers and staff to collaboratively consider their data and research in preparation for the final write-up of their research. On completion of this subject, students will have completed a self-study/action research project and understand research processes that can be utilised to improve and inform practice and policy throughout the field. </p>",
        "<p>As part of the overall Graduate Certificate in Early Childhood Research course, students will participate in a Collective (small group of students) with a Collective Mentor (staff member/lecturer). The Collective serves as a consistent support for the student throughout the course and in relation to this subject.</p>"
