    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will introduce Teacher Candidates to theoretical perspectives on physical, personal, social, emotional, cognitive and spiritual aspects of infant and toddler development and learning as an integrated process. Teacher Candidates will examine the relationship of development and learning, with a focus on the developing brain and the significance of early relationships and wellbeing for learning. Teacher Candidates will explore infant and toddler positioning in family, friend and community networks and the range of factors contributing to young children\u2019s learning and development, emphasising agency, wellbeing and social connectedness. Links will be made between children\u2019s learning and development and the VEYLDF learning framework and outcomes. Content includes the underlying learning processes being established in infant and toddler development, such as regulation, memory, attention, curiosity, and gathering information. The subject includes a focus on diversity and inclusion to promote the learning and participation needs of all learners across the full range of abilities, to build effective relationships with families, and in managing the use of professional documentation.</p>"
