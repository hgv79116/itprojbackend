    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is the first in a series of four MD Discovery subjects embedded within the Doctor of Medicine course. Students will engage in 87.5 credit points of discovery-based learning in areas of interest across their course. Discovery learning allows medical students to engage in flexible, personalised and increasingly complex situational learning as they progress, providing opportunities to reflect on the professional practice of medicine in a variety of contexts and settings.<br/><br/>Every medical practitioner has areas in which they have a particular interest, both within medicine and more broadly. Discovery learning allows medical students to explore in greater depth an area of interest within which they would like to develop expertise, enhancing their professional practice and life experience.<br/><br/>Discovery learning in the first year of the Doctor of Medicine provides students with opportunities to engage with and explore their chosen area of interest at a foundational level. Learning Advisors support students in selecting their discovery pathway from a curated range of options, including complete subjects that may be substituted as well as smaller modules. The Learning Advisors will also ensure that any option or combination will meet the subject learning outcomes. Each of the options will also align with the overarching Doctor of Medicine Course Intended Learning Outcomes and are designed to enhance the student\u2019s personal and professional growth. Students with limited prior learning in the enabling biosciences will be encouraged to choose options that address these areas, based on a learning needs analysis, although their choices will remain broad.<br/><br/>This subject, \u201cMD Discovery 1: Foundation\u201d may be taken as a stand-alone learning experience or as part of a vertical thread throughout the course.</p>"
