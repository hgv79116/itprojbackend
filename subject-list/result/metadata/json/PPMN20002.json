It will take seriously the widest possible range of perspectives on climate change, locally, nationally and globally, and ask which views and what knowledge counts when it comes to climate change.</p>",
        "<p>This subject will critically investigate the ways in which scientific knowledge, competing value systems, and considerations of power intersect when it comes to climate change policy. It will give students the concepts and tools to understand and engage with disputes around climate change and equip them to understand other controversial policy questions.</p>",
