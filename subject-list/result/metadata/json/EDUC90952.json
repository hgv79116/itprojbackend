    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject examines the intersection between science and culture as it is experienced and communicated by individuals, groups and institutions, in particular, in settings such as museums, zoos and science education centres. Science communication is critical in these present times, for educators, media specialists, scientists, businesses and industries and for every citizen. At a time when there is increased participation in communication through personal, social and mobile technologies, an understanding of both your place and potential as an interpreter and communicator of science is essential. This subject will provide you with the benefits of skills that will assist you to interrogate our contemporary culture and the place of science within it. These skills would include the means by which to question and respond to the communication challenges inherent in such agendas as the promotion of science, the constructing of public awareness and knowledge of science and the developments of critical, scientifically literate citizens. These skills will be developed in settings that are set up to promote these agendas, that is, museums, zoos and science education centres, culminating in a personal understanding of your own capacities and opportunities in the field of science communication.</p>"
