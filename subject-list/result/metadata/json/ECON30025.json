    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject covers the application of computer based techniques to solve the problems encountered in economics and business. The techniques covered include the construction and use of hierarchical data sets, the use of multivariate graphics and statistics in the context of data mining applications, the elements of computer simulations, and the application of linear programming for the analysis of productivity in the context of data envelopment analysis. One aspect of this subject is the introduction of students to different software options. Possible software to be considered will be SAS, Stata, GAUSS, SPSS, TSP, EMS, Scientific Word, and <em>Eviews</em>.</p>"
