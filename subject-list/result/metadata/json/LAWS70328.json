        "<p>The fallout from the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) has put significant pressure on securities markets in Australia, which form part of the broader market for financial products and services. In the past few years, there have been significant developments in relation to the operation of the market for securities, including government approval for a new market operator (Chi-X). There has also been a regulatory response to the collapse of high-profile financial service providers, such as Storm Financial and Opes Prime. This subject will deal with these developments as well as recent case law relating to the responsibilities of listed entities, especially under the continuous disclosure regime and with other examples of market misconduct.</p>",
