    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is a capstone subject within the Master of Public Health. In this unit, students will have the opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills acquired in the pre-requisite subjects to real-world scenarios through a Problem Based Learning (PBL) approach. Students will be presented with a range of contemporary public health issues that will require them to consider an appropriate population health response. These scenarios will expose students to a range of public health roles, perspectives and problems that they, as future public health practitioners, may be presented with in the real-world setting.</p>"
