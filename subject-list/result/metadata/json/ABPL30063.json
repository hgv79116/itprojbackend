    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is a two week intensive design studio held typically on the first two weeks of July. The workshop will be run by visiting staff from the Architectural Association, School of Architecture, UK as well as teaching staff from MSD. The subject introduces students to contemporary digital design techniques, toolset and workflow, striving for innovation in design resolution. Design briefs are wide ranging from urbanism intervention to 1:1 material systems, refer to subject\u2019s website <a href=\"http://www.projecttoria.com/\"><em>www.projecttoria.com</em></a><em>, </em> , usually published 1<sup>st</sup> week of April. The studio runs a unique vertical system where students develop project with their peers and is supported by a public program of seminars, lectures, design reviews and exhibition of outcome. All projects are conducted in group work. This subject is run concurrently with AA Visiting School (Graduate) subject. This subject provides opportunity for undergraduate student to develop design skills in a graduate school design studio environment.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Pre- teaching: </strong></p>",
        "<p>Students will be required to undertake online learning modules or attend a workshop for specific software used during the subject. This usually take place one week prior to the start of the subject.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Incidental costs: </strong></p>",
        "<p>Students will be required to purchase modelling and exhibition materials for the course excluding software; cost approx. $250 to $350 per person. Subject may have off campus activities with incidental cost for travel and accommodation - detail will be published on the subject\u2019s website <a href=\"http://www.projecttoria.com/\">www.projecttoria.com</a>, usually published the first week of April.</p>",
