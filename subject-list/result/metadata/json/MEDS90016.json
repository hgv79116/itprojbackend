    "overview": [
        "<p>In this subject students are given an opportunity to explore fundamentals of medical and in particular surgical science and the highly contentious issue of the importance, amount and timing of pure and applied (or integrated) biomedical science teaching and learning in medical education. We explore arguments for and against different approaches drawing on educational theory to explicate current positions. This subject explores changes in content and delivery of basic science programs for surgical training.</p>",
        "<p>Traditional approaches to teaching anatomy and other fundamentals of surgical science have been challenged. They are under threat for many reasons of which cost is a significant factor. The emergence of new medical schools, especially in rural locations further compounds the continued use of traditional methods for teaching anatomy. Of course, surgical science knowledge is fundamental to surgical training. However, surgical trainees now have fewer opportunities to learn using cadaveric and other traditional methods.</p>",
        "<p>Technology has provided new and exciting ways to impart surgical science knowledge. This subject enables participants to consider the challenges and future directions of surgical science teaching and to evaluate and consider alternatives to existing programs. Students are expected to apply theories from core and other elective subjects to advance and inform educational practice relevant for surgical science.</p>",
        "<p>The overall aims of this subject are:</p>",
        "<ul><li>To explore changes in content to surgical science programs</li><li>To consider challenges to traditional approaches to teaching surgical science</li><li>To evaluate contemporary approaches to teaching surgical science</li></ul>"
