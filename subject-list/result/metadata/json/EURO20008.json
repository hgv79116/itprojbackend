    "overview": [
        "<p>Italian cuisine is one of the most recognised and ubiquitous in the world. During the 20th century, it had a profound impact on the way Australians ate. In this 10-day intensive subject, alternatively taught in-county and in Melbourne and Victoria, students will learn about the centrality of eating to Italian ways of life and consider the relationship between identity, place and food. Through a series of programmed food activities, including hands-on experiences, students will explore different facets of Italian culinary culture, experiencing first-hand one of the most important food trends in Italy: slow food. Students will critique also the role of gender in relation to the food cultures of Italy in particular the gendering of authority in the high-end kitchen. Students will critique their own participation in food tourism and this subject will equip students with the conceptual and practical tools for developing intercultural sensitivity and adaptability. The in-country version will see students will spend approximately 10 days in Italy, while the Melbourne-based version will involve a series of excursions to country Victoria. Accommodation will be shared. Enrolment is by application and a quota will be applied. While there is no need to speak Italian to complete this subject, special arrangements can be made for languages students.</p>"
