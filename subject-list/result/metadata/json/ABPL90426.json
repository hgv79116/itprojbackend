    "overview": [
        "<p>How might design thinking strategies help you resolve complex, ill-defined and changing issues within the built environment? In this subject you will apply design thinking techniques to understand and empathise with the end user, then to define, ideate, prototype and test solutions to complex problems. Traditional linear approaches to problem solving will be replaced with generative and hands-on strategies aimed at opening up possibilities for testing. Analysing and synthesising information will help iteratively define the problem issues. Co-design strategies and alternative ways to view and resolve problems will reveal and challenge assumptions. Whether you come from a design or non-design background, this subject will open new possibilities for complex problem solving by applying critical and creative design thinking approaches.</p>"
