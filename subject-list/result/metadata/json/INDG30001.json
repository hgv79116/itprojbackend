    "overview": [
        "<p>The capstone subject will allow students to draw together the knowledge and learning experiences they have had in the Indigenous Studies Major. Students will also have the opportunity to reflect on the deeper implications of this knowledge and apply multidisciplinary research perspectives to a project of their own choosing. Many lectures will be delivered by eminent Aboriginal and Settler practitioners in such fields as education, the public sector, health, law, the media, arts and culture. Students will have the opportunity to engage in dialogue with these practitioners and demonstrate an informed awareness of relevant policy developments in these areas and knowledge of cultural sensitivities. This subject is the practical fruition of the interdisciplinary perspectives that make up the Indigenous Studies major and connects those perspectives to the social world. Students will have the opportunity to explore the intersection between those disciplinary perspectives and cognate ideas in various fields of practice. Students will also have the chance to experience the spectrum of vocational possibilities in Australian Indigenous affairs, and finally, to develop and communicate a mature and broad intellectual perspective on Australian Indigenous affairs.</p>"
