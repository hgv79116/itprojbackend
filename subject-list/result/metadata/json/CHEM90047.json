        "<p>The emergence of organic electronics is transforming current electronic technologies that will lead to light-weight flexible devices such as foldable displays, building-integrated lighting and low-cost solar cells. This subject will give an overview of this new technology area. A range of topics will be covered including materials design and synthesis, materials characterisation, and device applications. There will be an emphasis on organic semiconducting materials and photovoltaic devices.</p>"
