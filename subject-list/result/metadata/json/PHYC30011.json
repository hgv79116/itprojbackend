    "overview": [
        "<p>The subject provides an introduction to the unified picture of elementary particles and atomic nuclei - how the elementary quarks combine to form strongly interacting particles, and how two of these, the proton and neutron combine to form atomic nuclei; how quarks and their composites interact with the leptons and with each other; how we study these systems experimentally; and the exciting unanswered questions in this field of physics.</p>",
        "<p>Topics covered will be selected from: quarks and leptons; strong, electromagnetic and weak interactions; symmetries and conservation laws; structure, models and properties of hadrons; structure, models and properties of nuclei; scattering and decay processes; accelerators; detectors; fission and fusion reactors; applications of nuclear and particle physics techniques; and other topics in sub-atomic physics of contemporary interest.</p>"
