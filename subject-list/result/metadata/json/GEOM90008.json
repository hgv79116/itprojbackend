    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject combines practical spatial data management with the underpinning theories of spatial and spatiotemporal data representation and handling from Geographic Information Science. Spatial information is answering \u2018where\u2019 and \u2018when\u2019 questions \u2013 which are fundamental in decision making in complex systems, be it in urban planning, traffic and infrastructure management, environmental management, public health and sustainability, or any other social, economic, and environmental context.</p>",
        "<p>The subject introduces foundations of effective, efficient, and large-scale spatial data management. This subject will cover the concepts, methods, and approaches that allow for efficient representation, querying, and retrieval of spatial data, in a modern ecosystem of spatial databases interfacing a geographic information system.</p>",
        "<p>The knowledge acquired is fundamental for subsequent studies in spatial data analytics and visualisation, and is of particular relevance to people wishing to establish a career in the spatial information, the environmental, or the planning industry. It is also suited for every postgraduate student who is looking for solid skills with Geographic Information Systems.</p>",
        "<p>In this subject, we will discuss the intricacies of computational representation and management of spatial information. The subject takes a spatial database perspective to management of extensive spatial datasets. The subject will cover the modelling, loading, transformation, analysis, and retrieval of spatial data in spatial databases. The subject covers data representations (vector, raster, and network data); spatial operations, including geometric, topological, set-oriented, and network operations; spatial indexes and access methods, including quadtrees and R-trees. The subject exposes the students to the whole lifecycle of spatial data management in a team-based project.</p>"
