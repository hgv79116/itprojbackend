        "<p>This subject aims to extend the fundamental concepts of heat transfer to include natural and forced convection; boiling and condensation; plate heat exchanger and evaporator design. Fundamental concepts in mass transfer are expanded to the design of separation processes including binary distillation, gas absorption, solvent extraction, membranes and cooling towers.</p>"
