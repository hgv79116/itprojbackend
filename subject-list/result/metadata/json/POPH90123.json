    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject covers statistical models for longitudinal and correlated data. Beginning with models based on normal distributions, the concept of hierarchical data structures is developed. Numerical and analytical examples are used to demonstrate the inadequacy of standard statistical methods, including the limitations of the repeated-measures analysis of variance. Extensions to non-normal data using generalised estimating equations (GEE\u2019s) and generalised mixed linear models (GLMM\u2019s) are explored using the R and Stata statistical software packages.</p>"
