    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is aimed at students undertaking graduate research programs. The overall aim is to introduce students to core qualitative methods and techniques commonly used in management and marketing research. It provides students with a working knowledge of the spectrum of alternative approaches of collecting data (including case studies, interviews, ethnography, archival and documentary evidence and physical and visual artefacts), and alternative techniques for analysing and interpreting qualitative data. Whilst this subject will not provide the depth required of a specialist in any particular technique, by the end of this subject, students will be able to read, unpack and critique a research paper using a particular qualitative method.</p>"
