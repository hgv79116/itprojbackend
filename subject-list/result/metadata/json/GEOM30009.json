        "<p><strong>AIMS</strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject will introduce students to the use of imagery in the mapping of both human and natural environments. Imaging is often the most convenient way to gain spatial information about the environment, especially for large areas. Analysis and interpretation of the imagery requires understanding the principles of electromagnetic radiation, interaction of light with the atmosphere and the object surface, and how the reflected light is recorded by the imaging sensors. This enables the students to identify and analyse the image content such as different land cover types, vegetation, water, and man-made objects. Once interpreted, the information must be communicated to others, usually in the form of maps or reports. This subject builds on a student\u2019s knowledge of the physical and built environment relevant to their discipline and allows them to interpret and communicate that knowledge. On completion of the subject students should have the skills to perform routine image analysis tasks in the workplace using industry standard software. The subject is of particular relevance to students wishing to establish a career in infrastructure engineering, civil engineering, property management, surveying, spatial information and urban planning but is also relevant to a range of disciplines where imaging should be considered.</p>",
