    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject allows students to conduct an independent, original research project in a specified area of climate science. The project comprises a review of a body of literature, a review and discussion of prior research, development of a research plan, followed by some original research. The specific focus of the research project will be developed through discussion with an academic supervisor on a topic that is aligned with the student and supervisor\u2019s interests, taking into account the necessary and available expertise, data, and facilities. Proposals for research projects must be submitted to the subject coordinator in the semester prior to commencement in the subject. Final approval for the topic lies with the subject co-ordinator.</p>",
        "<p>The work will be equivalent to lecture and practical based subjects worth 25 points. The work commitment includes regular one-hour meetings with supervisors where students report on progress, difficulties, research plans and research results. The majority of the time will be spent on independent research activities by the student.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Note:</strong> Students commencing their Climate Science Research Project in Semester 1 should enrol into the Year Long availability. Students commencing their project in Semester 2 should enrol into the Semester 2 availability. </p>"
