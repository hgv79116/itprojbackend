    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides practical support and guidance for participants preparing to undertake their research project in the second semester. It builds on the theoretical research paradigms and methods introduced in the graduate diploma research subject by supporting clinicians to develop and define a research question, and appropriate research design and methods. Recognising that clinicians have many competing demands on their time, the seminar days are workshops that will allow participants to develop important resources such as their clarified research question, literature search strategy, project design and ethics application.</p>"
