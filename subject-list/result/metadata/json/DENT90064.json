    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will assist students in developing knowledge regarding the common oral diseases that are caused by bacteria that are part of dental plaque, especially periodontitis and dental caries. This is a highly integrated subject that brings together advanced concepts in chemistry, biochemistry, microbiology, immunology, pharmacology, anatomy, behavioural science and clinical practice that are relevant to the understanding of oral health and disease. The students will learn about these diseases at the community, individual, cellular and molecular level. They will learn about the host immune response to both oral commensal and pathogenic bacteria. They will also learn about the links between oral and systemic health. Students will engage in extensive preclinical activities, problem-based and computer-based learning exercises that will enable them to make treatment decisions and prepare them for dental clinical practice.</p>",
        "<p>In Block 3 students will gain knowledge of common oral preventive procedures such as manual plaque control and use of preventive agents such as toothpastes and topical fluorides. Students will gain knowledge in the interpretation of bitewing radiographs.</p>"
