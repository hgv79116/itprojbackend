        "<p>The Research Project develops a student\u2019s ability to design and undertake a substantial body of work, to find solutions to an issue, and to report on this in written and verbal form. The project topic is developed in close collaboration between student and academic supervisors. Project definition is completed shortly after commencement of the semester of enrolment in the subject, and requires approval from the subject coordination committee. Logistic assistance for projects is coordinated on a case-by-case basis. Each student prepares a short oral presentation on their project proposal, which is peer-reviewed, as well as a written proposal (5-8 pages) to be assessed by the subject coordination committee. A more detailed oral presentation is presented on the final results of the project to an audience of Faculty staff.</p>"
