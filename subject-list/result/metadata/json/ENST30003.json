    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject explores and evaluates green infrastructure technologies, including green roofs, green walls, green facades and water-sensitive urban design installations. Students study the underpinning science that supports these technologies and their use in urban environments to achieve environmental, social and economic outcomes, including plant ecology, horticulture, hydrology and the science of growing media including soils and green-roof substrates. There is a strong emphasis on understanding the functions of different design systems and the engineering applications of green infrastructure in landscape and building installations. The subject also uses case studies, field visits and industry practitioners to investigate, analyse and evaluate green infrastructure technologies and systems.</p>"
