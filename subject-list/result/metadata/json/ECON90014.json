    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject aims to provide students with a standard  tool kit to analyse dynamic macroeconomic models and to give a detailed coverage of some important applications in macroeconomics. The subject is composed of four parts. Part I provides a brief review of the formal theory of dynamic optimization. Part II devotes to some general numerical techniques to solve and simulate a dynamic model. Part III introduces some econometric techniques that are used to estimate a structural model with data. Part IV focuses on applications of these techniques in some important research areas of macroeconomics, including real business cycle models and its various extensions, incomplete market models, firm dynamics models, monetary models. </p>"
