    "overview": [
        "<p><strong>This subject was formerly known as Structures and Construction Systems.</strong></p>",
        "<p>Commercial construction can take many forms and often includes a multitude of complex systems with specific plant and equipment requirements. These commercial buildings can include high, medium or low rise office or apartment buildings, hospitals and institutional buildings, shopping centres, sporting facilities and warehouse industrial sheds. Each project has characteristic structural forms and resultant methods of construction. This subject investigates the various structural design concepts and their influence on construction. The topics covered include the interpretation of steelwork drawings and specifications, steel frame buildings and wide span industrial sheds, warehouse concrete pavements, basement construction and site retention methods, piling systems and construction methods to suit various geotechnical conditions, tilt slab construction methods and precast concrete building systems. Construction detailing and constructability are the key issues covered within each topic, together with organisation of the construction process and hybrid construction systems.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Incidental costs</strong></p>",
        "<p>Students will be required to purchase personal protective equipment (steel-toed boots, hard-hat, hi-vis vest and safety goggles); cost approx. $80 to $120 per person. Students may use equipment from a previous subject if these are in good working condition</p>"
