    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of advertising in the changing media environment. Through set readings, case studies and class discussions, students will be introduced to a wide range of issues surrounding advertising, including the rise of consumerism and materialism, the current advertising industry, advertising and consumer wellbeing, and persuasion through covert and data-driven advertising. The subject will also address the implications of advertising practices on critical groups such as children and youth and discuss ethics and regulations. Lessons from this subject will enhance students\u2019 knowledge and understanding of different ways in which advertising informs and influences society and help students become responsible persuaders and competent media users.</p>",
        "<p>This subject does not focus on how to create advertisements or develop communications campaigns. Instead, it concentrates on how advertising is placed in a larger economic, regulatory, and social context, with an aim to provide an important foundation for practice.</p>"
