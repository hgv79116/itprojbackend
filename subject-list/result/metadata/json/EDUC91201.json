    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject examines the role of education in the development process of developing and least developed countries. Students will utilise key theories of education and development to critically analyse the complex relationship between education (formal, non-formal, informal) and development (economic, social, political).</p>",
        "<p>Students will analyse the impact of global development frameworks such as Sustainable Development Goals on educational policies at the regional, national and local levels and critically assess the role of development partners (such as the World Bank) in influencing and shaping the education and development priorities of developing and least developed countries.</p>",
        "<p>Students will also engage with current debates about the role and purpose of education, in particular the role of Technical, Vocational Education Training (TVET) and lifelong learning in socio-economic development, and consider how these debates are influencing the policy, funding, governance, and delivery of education in developing and least developed countries.</p>"
