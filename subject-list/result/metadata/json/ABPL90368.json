    "overview": [
        "<p>The subject critically examines the contemporary and historical modes in which architecture engages with media. This subject will include a focus on videogames media, game engines and experiencing digital game worlds by identifying physical-virtual exchanges. It is structured into two parts: lectures, readings and discussion in the first half of the semester, followed by a workshop format where students apply theory to practice and create digital narratives using new software skills in the second half of the semester. Students will develop and present the outcomes of a workshop series within the subject, including a fanzine, a digital gaming cartography and representations of digital interactive design.</p>"
