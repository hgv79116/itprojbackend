        "<p>This subject asks the question \u2018what makes a successful entrepreneur?\u2019 It\u2019s a complex topic and the subject of heated debate in the business, education and the economics communities, and also in discussions of international development, sustainability and social philanthropy. The way we will approach this subject is by looking at the behaviours, attitudes, values and skills that entrepreneurs need to create the climate for successful innovation - whether they are entrepreneurs starting new ventures or \u2018Entrepreneurs\u2019 in large organisations. What you will discover in this subject is that innovation isn\u2019t just about having great ideas, and that entrepreneurs aren\u2019t who you think they are. The subject will do this by looking at topics such as how innovation works and how it can be managed, different modes of entrepreneurialism, how entrepreneurs think and how to create, build and sustain an entrepreneurial business.</p>",
