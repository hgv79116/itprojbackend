        "<p>The aim of this subject is an improved understanding of educational practice and theory, leading to deeper comprehension and innovative practice. Through an examination of their practice students will develop sophisticated conceptions of how teaching and learning support knowing and understanding. We begin by thinking through, writing about and sharing our personal experience of teaching and learning situations. These teaching and learning situations will be analysed and synthesised through an exploration of educational philosophies, particularly those concerned with experience but also those dealing with the relationship between knowledge and power. This process will enable interpretation and evaluation of the various ways our conceptions of teaching and learning support knowing and understanding. This will result in students\u2019 increased capacity to improve teaching practice, leading to more effective learning, knowing and understanding in the interests of student equity.</p>"
