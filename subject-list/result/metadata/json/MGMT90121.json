    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject covers key frameworks for making complex business decisions and implementing using the philosophy and techniques of project management. It specifically covers an in-depth study of decision trees and risk analysis, followed by decision implementation and organisation. Case studies relating to supply chain management will be used to develop applied knowledge of how to use these procedures to formulate and implement strategy in supply chains. Project management concepts and applications are developed as the powerful approach for managing strategy implementation, change management and facilities development. Project management philosophies and techniques are applied to supply chain design and implementation.</p>"
