    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is available to students from the Spanish and Latin American Studies program, as well as to breadth students with no Spanish language proficiency. Taught in Spanish and English, Tales of Muslim Spain takes students on a journey from Madrid to southern Spain, and Morocco. Tales of Muslim Spain teaches students about the influence of Muslim culture on Spanish way of life through a combination of course work, visits to cities, villages, and landscapes; and on-site experiences, including flamenco events, concerts, nightlife, culinary activity, and visits to art galleries. Students will gain, too, an understanding of Spain as a nation and kingdom uniquely positioned between Africa and Europe. Students will additionally examine (in Spanish or English) the role of historical fiction in contemporary Spain as Spaniards seek to reimagine the past by re-framing their historical treatment of Muslim and Jewish communities to project a self-image of religious and cultural tolerance. The subject will equip students with the conceptual and practical tools for developing intercultural sensitivity and cultural humility in their interactions with other cultures during their time in Spain and North Africa.</p>"
