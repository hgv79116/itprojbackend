    "overview": [
        "<p>As manufacturers compete in the global market, their success largely depends on the ability to reduce time in the product development process, improve product quality and productivity, lower cost in the manufacturing process, fulfil customer's requirements and address environmental concerns.  Therefore, this subject aims to equip students with a systematic approach to undertake abstract and concrete design tasks, considering the broader engineering environment and the ability to select suitable manufacturing processes to realize their designs. </p>",
        "<p>Topics include an overview of the theory of design and concurrent engineering, conceptual and detailed design based on customer requirements, design for manufacturing and assembly, cost-effective design and environmentally conscious design.  This project-based subject allows students to work individually and in a team environment to design and manufacture a functional product.</p>",
