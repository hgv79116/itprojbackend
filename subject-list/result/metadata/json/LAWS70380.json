Primary legislation is the Australian Consumer Law (ACL), found in Schedule 2 of the <em>Competition and Consumer Act 2010</em>(Cth); equivalent provisions in the <em>Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001</em> (Cth) (ASIC Act) applying to financial services and products; and, for consumer credit, the <em>National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009</em> (NCCP Act). This subject  explores the key features of the consumer protection regimes underlying the supply of goods, services and credit to consumers, along with the common law principles and policy imperatives that underpin these regimes.
