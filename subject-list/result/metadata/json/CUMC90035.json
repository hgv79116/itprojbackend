    "overview": [
        "<p>The student proposes an original research topic that contributes to existing bodies of conservation knowledge and is approved by the coordinator. The student then initiates and conducts an involved program of primary research requiring interdisciplinary skills and knowledge. The student conducts the independent research under the guidance of an academic supervisor, and produces a critical research report. The thesis is undertaken across two consecutive semesters and in some cases, access to cultural collections in the field maybe required.</p>"
