        "<p>The subject builds on the content of Interactive Composition 1, 2, 3 and 4. It further examines the skills required for individual composers to develop their craft in interactive music making and include a critical reflection and analysis presentation.</p>",
        "<p>Interactive Composition is delivered in two parts: Tutorial and Workshop. Tutorial is taught primarily by a specialist mentor through a mixture of individual and group tutorials. Workshop is taught as a seminar and provides the opportunity for group discussion of issues related to interactive composition and a forum for the workshop of new works.</p>",
        "<p>During the subject, students will be required to engage in whole group discussion, and to present complete and ongoing interactive compositions.</p>"
