    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject focuses on the productive intersection between feminist and queer theories and Science, Technology, and Society (STS). Engagement with feminist and queer theories will deepen understanding of scientific research and knowledge production and will offer a critical understanding on how various conceptual, epistemological and ontological assumptions are produced and challenged. Feminist and queer theories will foreground how gender and other structures of inequalities such as race, class, sexuality, and ablebodiedness inform inquiry into any topic in the humanities, social sciences, and sciences.</p>",
        "<p>The first part of the subject will focus on foundational texts that offer a critical analysis of binaries such as nature/culture, and subjectivity/objectivity. The second part of the subject will explore contemporary trends in feminist and queer STS such as decolonial feminist approach, new materialism, and critical posthumanism among others.</p>"
