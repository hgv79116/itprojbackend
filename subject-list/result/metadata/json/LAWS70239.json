This subject aims to provide students with a detailed understanding of the contractual procedures for payment and associated issues such as set-off.

The lecturers are based in the two states that have been at the forefront of the reforms\u2014Queensland and New South Wales\u2014and are therefore well-placed to guide students through this area of law.</p>",
