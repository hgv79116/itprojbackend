        "<p>Pastures and grasslands comprise the dominant vegetation cover across the Australian continent. The way pastures and grasslands are managed is therefore central to the sustainable use of natural resources such as soil and water, as well as the economic development of the pasture-based livestock industries (meat and wool sheep, beef cattle, and dairy).</p>",

        "<ul><li>An overview of Australia's pasture and grassland resources</li><li>The population biology of pasture plants, including the growth cycles of annual and perennial plants, and pathways of plant survival</li><li>The major pasture plant species and pasture types, their agronomic and adaptive characteristics and management requirements</li><li>Pasture improvement principles and practices</li><li>Plant and pasture growth processes influencing the accumulation of yield in pastures, and implications for management</li><li>The feeding and nutritive value of pastures and factors affecting animal intake</li><li>The principles and practices of grazing management</li></ul>"
