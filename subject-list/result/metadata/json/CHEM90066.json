    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides in depth training in the technique of X-ray crystallography for the determination of chemical and macromolecular structures. Students will be exposed to the theory that underpins this technique, its practical application and the interpretation and validation of its results. Students will apply current software packages to real data to determine the structures of chemical complexes and proteins. Cutting-edge techniques, particularly those accessible through the Australian Synchrotron that provide complementary structural information will also be discussed.</p>"
