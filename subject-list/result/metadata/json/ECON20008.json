    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides an historical overview of the development of the Australian economy. A major theme of the subject is to understand the role of factors such as geography, political and legal institutions, international influences such as immigration and foreign investment, and economic policy, in the development of the Australian economy. The subject will emphasise how an understanding of the economic history of Australia can be used to analyse current developments in the Australian and international economies. The evolution of the Australian economy and of material well-being, and the role of major episodes such as agricultural development, gold rushes and mining booms, world wars, and major economic fluctuations, are examined.</p>"
