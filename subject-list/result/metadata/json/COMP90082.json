        "<p>This subject gives students in the Master of Information Technology experience in analysing, designing, implementing, managing and delivering a software project related to their stream of IT speciality. The aim of the subject is to guide students in being an independent member working within a team over the major phases of IT development, giving hands-on practical application of the topics seen throughout their degree. The subject also gives students a concrete understanding of teamwork processes and tools that underpin the practical aspects of developing software.</p>",
        "<p><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT</strong></p>",
        "<p>Students will work in small teams to conceive, analyse, design, implement, test, and maintain a software product for a group of stakeholders. Workshops are tied closely to the projects and the particular phases of each project and will explore the application of theory to the project, including topics on: requirements analysis, software design, software release, communication, ethical principles, and software project management tools. Students will be required to demonstrate independence while working as part of a team.</p>"
