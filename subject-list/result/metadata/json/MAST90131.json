    "overview": [
        "<p>Measurement analytics combines measurement science and validity theory with analytics methods. Its main application is to assess human (or sometimes organisational) performance or attributes, using digital big data and analytical techniques. Use of measurement analytics is appropriate when the objective of the analyst is to build reliable and valid assessments of individuals, especially when attributes or levels of performance can only be inferred, not directly observed, and when results have consequences for the individuals concerned.</p>",
        "<p>There are many applications: in education, to any assessment of competence or understanding; in health and human services, to assessments of patient physiological or psychological status; in the professions and vocations for recruitment, to assessment of complex skills, including in areas such as music, sport, and non-cognitive attributes such as attitudes, values and beliefs; and in situations when automated assessments are generated from games, essays, videos or interviews.</p>",
        "<p>In this subject students will develop an understanding of the rationale for using measurement analytics rather than alternative analytics techniques and become familiar with contemporary and emerging applications. This subject provides students with the ability to assess claims to reliability and validity of analytics-based assessments of attributes or performance of individuals, and provides basic understandings and skills in how to maximize validity using complex digital data.</p>"
