They are also given opportunities to develop \u2018language sensitivity\u2019 by deepening their comprehension of language use in various situation. Students who complete this subject should gain better control of the language and greater knowledge about how grammar develops and regulates language use in actual situations. On completion of the subject, students should be able to evaluate the appropriateness of various grammatical structure in use in Japanese interactions.
