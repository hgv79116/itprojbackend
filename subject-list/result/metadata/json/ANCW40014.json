    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject supports the development of the skills and knowledge required to undertake research in the field of Ancient world Studies. Students will investigate current issues, tools and methodologies in the field, and work on formulating and presenting a research project related to their thesis. Future research pathways and the current international context for the study of antiquity will also be explored. Students will evaluate and utilise a number of different approaches to the ancient culture as well as develop practical skills needed for a research career in the field. Classes in some weeks will be divided into archaeology and classical studies streams. Students will be able to select a stream, with coordinator approval, at the commencement of the subject.</p>"
