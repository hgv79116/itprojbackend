    "overview": [
        "<p>Migration is one of the most significant drivers of social change in the developing world. The objective of this subject is to examine key issues and debates around the migration - development nexus, drawing on conceptual, theoretical, and empirical studies in human geography, anthropology, sociology, demography, and political science. Class debates and exercises will deepen students\u2019 understanding of the conceptual models and theoretical frameworks that have been used to analyse migration and development. Important concepts such as transnationalism, forced migration, global care chains, governmentality, and global householding will be examined and critiqued. We will also look into economic, social and cultural implications of migration for development processes at both micro and macro levels, assessing the links between migration and key debates in development such as globalisation, poverty, gender and social change.</p>"
