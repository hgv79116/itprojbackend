It also investigates the role of public participation in shaping public policy. </p>",
        "<p>It will draw on insights from regulatory science, political theory, and science &amp; technology studies to give students the concepts and analytical tools to understand how science shapes, and is shaped by, regulation. The issues will be explored through a number of detailed cases, including cross-country comparisons of different regulatory approaches. </p>"
