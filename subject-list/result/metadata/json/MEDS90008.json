        "<p>This subject introduces participants to education theory and its application in medical and surgical training. Participants will gain a broad appreciation of the \u2018educational landscape\u2019 with an opportunity to pursue one theory in detail. Both teacher and learner perspectives will be explored and participants will critically reflect on their experiences from both perspectives. The subject is intentionally theoretical as it provides essential grounding for all subsequent subjects in which there will be opportunities to apply theory to practice.</p>",
        "<p>The overall aims of this subject are:</p>",
        "<ul><li>To provide participants with a working knowledge of key contemporary education theory including teacher and learner perspectives</li><li>To consider the application of these theories in surgical education</li></ul>"
