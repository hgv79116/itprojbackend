        "<p>In fiercely competitive global and dynamic environments, organisations face increasing pressures to exceed stakeholder expectations across measures such as sustainability, social responsibility, cost, quality, flexibility and innovativeness.  Although operations are at the core of an organisation's value adding activities, few organisations build a sustainable competitive advantage around these capabilities.</p>",

It covers core operations concepts essential for leveraging an organisation\u2019s capabilities to achieve sustainable competitive advantage. It also provides a logical and rigorous approach to plan and control process structure and managerial levers to achieve desired business process performance.</p>"
