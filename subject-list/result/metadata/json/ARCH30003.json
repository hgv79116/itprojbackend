    "overview": [
        "<p>Environmental Design-Commercial forms part of the Environmental Systems specialisation.</p>",
        "<p>This subject  prioritises the sustainable building design process and assessment tools used in the design of BCA class 3 \u2013 9 buildings, which includes office, hospital, education, school, hotel, aged care, warehouse and factory. </p>",
        "<p>The subject combines theoretical knowledge of the environmental performance of commercial buildings (such as energy, comfort, water, daylight, waste, ecology, innovation) with a practical understanding of how the industry assesses them in accordance with Town Planning, BCA, Greenstar, NABERS and other specialty assessment tools. These skills are closely aligned with the required knowledge of the graduate ESD consultant positions, typically in architecture or engineering firms. </p>",
        "<p>The subject will maximise industry involvement through guest speakers, case studies and site visits.</p>"
