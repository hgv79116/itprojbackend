    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides a detailed investigation of human visceral anatomy. The subject will cover the terminology of human topographic anatomy as it relates to the head and neck, thorax, abdomen and pelvis; the principles of viscera and visceral systems; the detailed regional anatomy of each area including the walls and contents of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis; applied and clinical anatomy; and the appearance of normal anatomical visceral structures via modern imaging techniques. Lectures on anatomy will be supplemented by specialist lectures by practitioners to demonstrate the disciplinary breadth achievable with anatomical knowledge. Cadaveric dissection will be used to complement learning, by exposing the boundaries and contents of important regions of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis; and anatomical models, computer programs, prosected specimens and modern imaging techniques will be used to appreciate anatomical structures.</p>"
