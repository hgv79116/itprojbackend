    "overview": [
        "<p>Child and family welfare is a long-established field of practice for professional social workers, and this subject provides a foundation in the field of service to children at risk of harm, in the context of their family, carers and communities. Practice frameworks including public health and child rights approaches are considered, for understanding and responding to serious risk. Key legislation, policies, and previous and current efforts to reform the child protection systems,  within Australia are studied, with reference to international approaches. Students will learn about the functions and skills required of social workers practicing in this particular area.</p>",
        "<p>The subject is delivered online with weekly online tutorials, combining the flexibility of self-directed learning with peer discussions.</p>"
