    "overview": [
        "<p>Using an integrated and inter-disciplinary approach, this subject examines the structure, function and potential for dysfunction of the respiratory system of the major domestic animal species. As students develop an understanding of the mechanisms of disease of this system, they will develop skills in the clinical evaluation of it and in the interpretation of relevant diagnostic procedures. Students will integrate aspects of anatomy, clinical skills and imaging to enable understanding and implementation of the diagnostic process and treatment procedures.</p>"
