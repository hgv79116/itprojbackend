    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides a basis for students in the Digital Infrastructure Systems major to integrate and apply the knowledge they have gained throughout their studies to solve real-world problems. The students will work on projects to use knowledge of sensing, measurement, imaging, information system and information infrastructures. They will apply the acquired knowledge from their fundamental training and demonstrate an ability to design sustainable engineering projects. The subject will also provide ample opportunity for the students to gain experience and skills in how to perform a real-world, client-driven, interdisciplinary project, including important communication and organizational skills. </p>"
