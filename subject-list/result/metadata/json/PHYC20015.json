    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces Einstein\u2019s Special Principle of Relativity and develops the fundamental principles of electromagnetism and Maxwell\u2019s equations in differential form. Special relativity topics include the foundations of special relativity, spacetime invariance, simultaneity, and Minkowski diagrams, relativistic kinematics, the Doppler effect, relativistic dynamics, and nuclear reactions. Electromagnetism topics include the electric field (e.g. Gauss\u2019s law in integral and differential form, scalar potential and gradient, Poisson and Laplace equations), the magnetic field (e.g. Ampere\u2019s law in integral and differential forms), Maxwell\u2019s equations in vacuum (integral and differential forms), Maxwell\u2019s equations in matter (polarization, electric displacement, magnetic vector potential), time-varying electric and magnetic fields (Maxwell\u2019s equations in general form, wave equations for E and B, plane electromagnetic wave, Poynting vector). The presentation concludes with the relativistic formulation of the Lorentz force law.</p>"
