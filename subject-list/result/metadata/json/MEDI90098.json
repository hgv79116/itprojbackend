        "<p>In conjunction with Research Capstone Part 2 (MEDI90099), this subject builds on the Cancer Research subject (MEDI90086) by supporting students with the research, design and presentation of a project proposal and substantial literature review that will form the basis of their research project.</p>",
        "<p>In doing so, students will put into practice the advanced theoretical knowledge they have learnt during other Master of Cancer Sciences subjects and have the chance to explore an area of interest to them in detail. It will reinforce their abilities to evaluate existing research, utilise appropriate methodological techniques in cancer research, and to critically analyse and reflect on data.</p>"
