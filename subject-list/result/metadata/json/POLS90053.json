        "<p>As India\u2019s influence increases in the international system, understanding its foreign policy and its engagement with the rest of the world is critical for students of international relations.

The subject will familiarise students with the origins and conduct of India\u2019s foreign policy. Apart from taking stock of contemporary thinking and policies of the country, the major thrust of the course would be on the following areas: a.) Mapping the historical trajectory and pre-colonial roots of India\u2019s Foreign Policy; b) Institutions and decision-making process; c.) Intellectual debates on the nation\u2019s external relations in both the pre and post- independence era (esp. Moralism-Realism-Pragmatism); d.) Culture of Strategic Thinking in India\u2019s relations with the outside world; e.) India\u2019s approach towards Multilateralism (esp. Non-Proliferation, United Nations, Humanitarian Intervention, Trade and Environmental regimes)</p>"
