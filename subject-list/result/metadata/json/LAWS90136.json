    "overview": [
        "<p>Criminal law takes place in institutions. This subject studies the various public institutions that make up the official landscape of contemporary criminal law. It moves from police and prosecution offices, via anticorruption agencies and Royal Commissions, to courts and their procedures of trial and appeal, and thence to correctional prisons and allied custodial environments such as offshore detention regimes. Throughout, the central theme is the laws of criminal procedure and the ecology of institutional forums and officials that compose contemporary law. As French CJ remarked in his 2016 speech \u201cCriminal Law in the 21st Century\u201d, \u201ccriminal law engages the legal system generally \u2026. criminal lawyers cannot live in silos.\u201d</p>",
        "<p>The studies of criminal institutions provide an in-depth treatment of their complex problems, procedures and forms of knowledge. Our central concern is with what contemporary criminal law is doing, how it does so and why. In addressing this concern, the course moves from institutions of inquiry and investigation, to institutions of court and adjudication (committals, trials and appeal), and then institutions of sentencing, punishment and detention.  Three questions provide orientation throughout:</p>",
        "<ol><li>How do institutions of criminal law interact with and are affected by the conduct of other legal and social institutions?</li><li>How are criminal procedures to be understood in relation with rule, law and administration?</li><li>How are the lives of criminal lawyers lived with legal institutions?</li></ol>",
        "<p>These questions are developed in comparative and transnational contexts through the study of specific topics, which will be drawn from the following:</p>",
        "<ul><li>adversarial and non-adversarial styles of criminal law</li><li>commissions of inquiry, royal commissions, and anti-corruption agencies</li><li>a privilege against self-incrimination and the accusatorial character of criminal trial</li><li>police investigation techniques, and the audio-visual recording of confessions</li><li>committal proceedings and case management</li><li>the lives of criminal lawyers: defence lawyers and prosecution offices</li><li>criminal courtrooms: docks and design, handcuffs and security</li><li>trial by jury, trial by judge alone</li><li>the performance of the trial: the authority and responsibility of the judge</li><li>miscarriages of justice: appeals, experts and wrongful convictions</li><li>sentencing, appeals and aboriginal disadvantage</li><li>youth detention and youth justice</li><li>hyperlegality: prisons, prisoners and immigration detention</li><li>institutions of criminal law reform: commissioning institutions, procedures and officials</li></ul>",
        "<p>In-class teaching focuses on argument, advocacy and theoretical discussion through the close reading of texts. Invited speakers from a sample of criminal institutions studied will supplement, where possible, the in-class discussion. Assessment is designed to enhance research skills in criminal law, as well as explore topics of student interest in depth.</p>"
