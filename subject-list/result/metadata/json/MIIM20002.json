    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject describes how microbes are an essential part of our environmental ecology and participate in unique interactions within their environmental niche. This subject also describes how microbes (bacteria, viruses, parasites) cause infections in humans, and how our immune system responds. The characteristics of some of the pathogens which cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, sexually transmissible and hospital acquired infections are discussed together with the body\u2019s immune response to these pathogens, and the design of appropriate interventions, including vaccines and antimicrobials. The effects of both these infections and the interventions to control infectious diseases on communities and public health are also described so that the interaction between pathogen, host and environment can be illustrated.</p>",
        "<p>This is a fully integrated subject in which the lectures and the practical classes build on, and support, each other. The practical classes comprise a series of case studies which illustrate and revise material covered in the lecture, and aim to teach the safe and effective implementation of basic microbiological techniques.</p>"
