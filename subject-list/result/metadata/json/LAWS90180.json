    "overview": [
        "<p><strong>This subject will be delivered online in 2020 over the scheduled dates.</strong></p>",
        "<p>In the 21<sup>st</sup> century there are multiple levels of government, usually with a degree of constitutional protection, in many states across the world; and the numbers are increasing. The forms vary from federations to provincial or regional government to provision for special, usually asymmetrical autonomy. Multi-level government raises a range of conceptual and practical issues that this subject is designed to explore. In all its forms, it involves a departure to some degree from the assumptions and practices of unitary systems. The subject examines these from the perspectives of both design and operation, analysing the similarities and differences between the forms that multi-level government takes. In doing so, it canvasses topics that include democratic representation, the structure and operation of the public sector, the distribution of fiscal resources, the management of natural resources, judicial interpretation and constitutional change.</p>",
        "<p>The two instructors in the subject, Michael Crommelin and Cheryl Saunders, have a wealth of knowledge in the field that is brought together in this innovative subject.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics will include:</p>",
