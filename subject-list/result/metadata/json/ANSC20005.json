    "overview": [
        "<p>Animals such as dogs, cats and horses were once predominantly working animals but increasingly they are seen now as companion animals. This change in relationship has brought benefits and challenges to both owner and animal alike. Alongside traditional companion animal species, more exotic animals are also becoming popular in society. These may include reptiles, amphibians and even native Australian species.</p>",
        "<p>Given the almost complete control we have over companion animal species, it is important that we understand how to care for them correctly. Housing, nutrition, health and behaviour all interlink and impact on the welfare and value of our \u201ccompanions\u201d.</p>"
