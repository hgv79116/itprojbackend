        "<p>This subject investigates the ways in which children learn language and literacy, as well as the critical importance of both language and literacy in children\u2019s successful learning. The content in this subject will focus on both the typical developmental progression in language and literacy and the evidence-based strategies to build rich language and literacy programmes in early childhood settings.</p>",
        "<p>Teacher candidates will be introduced to the VEYLDF Outcome 5: Children are Effective Communicators and to the Victorian English Curriculum: Language Modes of Reading, Writing, and Speaking and Listening; and the Strands of Language, Literature, and Literacy.</p>",
        "<p>Additional topics covered in this subject include adult interactions supporting infant communication and language development, family literacy and the home learning environment, reading and writing development, as well as evidence based pedagogies for language, reading and writing learning. Digital technologies as a tool to support language and literacy learning will also be discussed. Students will also be introduced to the assessment of language and literacy in the context of children\u2019s learning.</p>"
