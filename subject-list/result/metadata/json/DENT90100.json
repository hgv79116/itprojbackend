    "overview": [
        "<p>Following on from Periodontics 1 this subject focuses on intermediate periodontal procedures, inter-relationships with other specialist branches of dentistry and the periodontal-systemic relationship. Learning is achieved through a series of weekly 3-hour seminars and clinical placements, which occur throughout the teaching period. The student will commence treatment of patients with periodontal disease, both non-surgically and surgically, placement of simple dental implants and begin to treat interdisciplinary cases.</p>",
        "<p> </p>",
        "<p>This subject aims to provide the student a comprehensive understanding of advanced periodontal procedures including surgery, guided tissue regeneration, mucogingival therapy, guided bone regeneration, healing following surgery and extraction. The student will enhance their understanding of clinical interrelationships between periodontics and endodontics, prosthodontics, restorative dentistry, orthodontics, paedodontics and gerodontics, and the knowledge of systemic diseases that may present in the periodontal tissues and treating medically compromised patients. Students will be introduced to topical, local and systemic anti-microbial agents used in periodontics and their spectrum of action.</p>",
        "<p>The student will further develop their surgical skills to encompass a variety of procedures building on from Periodontics 1. The student should have achieved an in-depth knowledge of implant dentistry especially surgical placement of implant, bone physiology and healing, implant surfaces and systems.</p>"
