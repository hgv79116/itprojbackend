        "<p>Topic, reading list, project timeline and format are agreed upon in collaboration between student and honours coordinator before the semester begins.</p>",
        "<p><strong>2023 Topic: Music and meaning from Bach to Beethoven and beyond. </strong></p>",
        "<p>In this subject we will explore the construction of meaning in Western music from the early Modern period to the present through the lens of the theory of musical topics. The concept of <em>topic</em> alludes to conventional figures that refer audiences to culturally shared worlds of meaning. Topical awareness can influence our understanding of individual works and help shape their interpretation. Although our main focus will be the Western art music tradition, the use of topics in other genres such as video game, popular, and film music will be considered. </p>",
