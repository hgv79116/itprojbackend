        "<p>The Foundations of Analytics is a core subject in the Health specialisation. It looks at the foundational principles and practice of modern data analytics, including techniques of data manipulation, presentation, and analysis. It\u2019s teaching approach will emphasis interpretation underpinned by an understanding of the appropriate use of data, rather than just disseminating the technical details about performing an analysis. Students will be introduced to probability models used for a continuous response and will learn how to use methods such as linear models, tree-based methods and forecasting. Students will also use statistical software to analyse data.</p>"
