        "<p>In this subject, students will learn how to apply best practice interventions and evaluate aural rehabilitation outcomes for clients with diverse backgrounds and needs. The subject builds on the fundamental knowledge and skills obtained in Sound and Innovative Solutions A and B. Through workshop-based activities and case studies, students will consider a broad range of management options for individuals with hearing loss. Students will also apply and consider modifications to management based on individual needs and abilities. By the end of this subject, students will understand the scope as well as the limitations of industry tools and be able to adapt educational and/or intervention programs that are client- and family-centred and evidence-informed. </p>"
