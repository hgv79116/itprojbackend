        "<p>Completion of the research project is intended to give students an appreciation of the processes involved in research, practical skills development, and the capacity to evaluate published research in the field of interest. As advised by the supervisor, the student studies appropriate research methodology and carries out a review of relevant literature and research for an investigative study resulting in the preparation of a report. The project offers students the opportunity to study in more depth themes discussed in previous subjects, and to apply these to an area of particular interest. The work should be a new study or development of an already existing study, which may involve collecting primary data from the field, evaluating or formulating a construct, or making a theoretical contribution. The result should give clear evidence of research skills and critical judgment.</p>"
