    "overview": [
        "<p>Many practical problems in management, operations research, telecommunication and computer networking can be modelled as optimisation problems on networks. Here the underlying structure is a graph. This subject is an introduction to optimisation problems on networks with a focus on theoretical results and efficient algorithms. It covers classical problems that can be solved in polynomial time, such as shortest paths, maximum matchings, maximum flows, and minimum cost flows. Other topics include complexity and NP-completeness, matroids and greedy algorithms, approximation algorithms, multicommodity flows, and network design. This course is beneficial for all students of discrete mathematics, operations research, and computer science.</p>"
