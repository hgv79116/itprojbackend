    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject presents nuclear reactor theory and its applications to reactor operation. It examines reactor response to control actions, feedback effects, and the intermediate and long-term effects on reactivity due to fission product poisoning and fuel burnup. Furthermore, it covers the fundamentals of thermal and hydraulic analysis of pressurised-water reactors.</p>",
