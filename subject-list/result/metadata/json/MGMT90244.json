    "overview": [
        "<p>As organisations become more sophisticated in how they seek to use analytics to inform business decision making, managers face several challenges in how to facilitate the creation of the best environment in which to deploy analytics.  This subject equips students with the necessary insights to formulate an organisation\u2019s vision and goals around the use of business analytics, along with specific tools to implement and manage the change processes required to achieve this.  In addition, students will be exposed to frameworks that will support their abilities in managing complex analytics projects and teams of data scientists, as well as how to effectively communicate, through various modes, topics in business analytics with the range of stakeholders in an organisation.</p>"
