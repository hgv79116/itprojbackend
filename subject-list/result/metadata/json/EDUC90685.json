        "<p>This subject focuses on the importance of planning effective literacy approaches and strategies to meet the needs of diverse learners. It will highlight how teachers cater for diversity through drawing on clinical approaches to meeting the literacy learning needs of diverse learners. Informing this subject will be an examination of the interface between literacy and social context, taking into account considerations of gender, EAL/D, socio-economic status, Indigenous status. Attention will be given to interventionist approaches that address the needs of exceptional learners. Turn around pedagogies and the need to counter deficit discourses in relation to diverse learners will be addressed in this subject.</p>"
