    "overview": [
        "<p>The aim of this subject is to develop advanced health assessment skills in nursing that are relevant to the student\u2019s area of clinical practice.</p>",
        "<p>The subject provides the foundation for the development of health assessment knowledge and skills that are required to practice in an advanced practice nursing role.</p>",
        "<p>The subject will explore diagnostic decision-making processes taking into consideration factors that impact on health and health assessment outcomes, such as: age, gender, culture, socioeconomic status and life-style.</p>",
        "<p>Students will use a client focused approach to health assessment and apply a structured framework to guide health assessment. History taking, general examination skills, diagnostic testing, and communication of assessment findings to the health care team and patient (written and verbal) will form the core content of the subject.</p>",
        "<p>Students will have the option of selecting areas that are relevant to their own area of practice. These topics will include: cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, cognitive and developmental, abdominal, alimentary and nutritional, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, integument and psychosocial assessment.</p>",
        "<p>The subject will provide students with strategies to assist them to develop advanced health assessment skills. Workshops, online activities, reading and resource material will be provided to assist students to develop the necessary knowledge and skills for advanced health examination and patient assessment. Students will also require clinical supervisors in their practice environment to support their learning, in particular the development of advanced specialty assessment skills and to assess their clinical performance.</p>"
