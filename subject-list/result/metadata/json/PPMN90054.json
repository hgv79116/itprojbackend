    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject enables students to compare the policy developments involved in politically, legally and constitutionally recognising Indigenous rights and sovereignty in Australia, New Zealand and Canada, with a particular focus on the negotiation of treaties. Starting with a focus on the Victorian experience, students will identify the most pertinent issues that should be considered by the Victorian Government in negotiating a treaty or treaties with Aboriginal peoples. Comparative cases will include the Treaty of Waitangi in Aotearoa/New Zealand and the modern treaty process in Canada, specifically in the province of British Columbia. Students will consider how these treaty processes have hindered and/or facilitated effective policy development and Indigenous governance.</p>",
        "<p>With the assistance of public policy academics and practitioners, participants will construct their own case study of citizen-state relationships focusing on debates around rights, sovereignty, decolonisation, self-determination, access to services and economic development and propose some key recommendations for future reforms.</p>"
