        "<p>The emphasis of the project can be associated with either -</p>",
        "<ul><li>A well-defined project description, often based on a task required by an external, industrial client. Students will be tutored in the synthesis of practical solutions to complex technical problems within a structured working environment, as if they were professional engineering practitioners; or</li><li>A project description that will require an explorative approach, where students will pursue outcomes associated with new knowledge or understanding, within the mechanical science disciplines, often as an adjunct to existing academic research initiatives.</li></ul>",
        "<p>It is expected that the project will incorporate findings associated with both well-defined professional practice and research principles.</p>"
