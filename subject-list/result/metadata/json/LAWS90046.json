    "overview": [
        "<p>The high-tech sector represents an increasingly important part of the world economy and is challenging the boundaries of orthodox competition law rules and approaches. Many of the most significant cases adjudicated by competition authorities around the world involve high-tech corporations (Microsoft, Intel, Google, Apple, etc). The high-tech industry is highly dynamic and raises particularly complex issues that need to be addressed by competition lawyers. This subject will grapple with these issues at a sophisticated level so that students understand the complex legal and economic challenges raised by the new economy. The lecturer is one of the world\u2019s leading experts in this field. He has been involved in some of the most significant high-tech cases as a partner in international law firms in Europe, as an expert witness in numerous arbitration and litigation proceedings, and as an academic, currently with posts at Tilburg University, George Mason University and University College London.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>The role of innovation as a goal of competition law</li><li>The influence of dynamic efficiency in competition law rule design and application, including in the areas of market definition, merger review and exemptions</li><li>The intersection between competition law and intellectual property rights, specifically as it arises in the high-tech sector</li><li>The intersection between competition law, consumer protection and privacy law, specifically as it arises in the high-tech sector</li><li>Competition law issues in multi-sided markets, including, for instance, search engines and the internet economy</li><li>Competition law issues raised by disruptive business models, such as Uber and Airbnb</li><li>Major cases, including the United States and European Union Microsoft cases, the EU Qualcomm case, the US Apple e-book case and the EU Google case.</li></ul>"
