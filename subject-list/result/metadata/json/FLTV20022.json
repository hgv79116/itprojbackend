        "<p>Movies and Money 1 introduces students with an interest in filmmaking to the fundamentals of screen production budgeting, finance and taxonomy from the Production Accountant\u2019s and Producer's perspective.</p>",
        "<p>Beginning with a creative and business overview, the subject engages with key financial concepts used in the film industry and introduces practical skills such as the application of film-related tax incentives and expenditure schemes in Australia. Delivery is through weekly online lectures presented by professional Production Accountants, as well as additional prescribed viewing that includes a wide range of screen-based material.</p>",
        "<p>The self-paced online learning modules are comprised of video lectures, practical exercises and weekly discussion boards. Students complete weekly online learning modules at their own pace. Assessments apply the knowledge gained in the lectures and additional viewing, with a focus on the application of film accounting principles to financial data taken from real-world screen-based productions.</p>",
        "<p>Movies and Money 1 is perfect for students who are seeking to know how financial systems in the screen industry work.</p>",
