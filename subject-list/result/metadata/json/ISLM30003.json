        "<p>This subject considers the rich heritage of ethical traditions in Islamic thought and some key modern debates. Students will critically examine key features and contributions of Muslim theologians, philosophers and Sufis who attempted to deal with revelation and rationalistic discourse in exploring the meaning of an ethical life as well as religious morality for Muslims. Are philosophy and religious wisdom equals (and allies) in the pursuit of human happiness? Students will be introduced to the genesis and development of rational and religious traditions with an emphasis on the application of ethical issues\u2014the meaning of \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019 conduct, free will, predestination, and human responsibility\u2014in Muslim societies. Areas of major contemporary ethical debates, including bioethics (abortion, IVF, euthanasia, cloning) will also be discussed from a Muslim perspective.</p>"
