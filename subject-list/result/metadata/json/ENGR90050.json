        "<p>Often prototyping is the best way to resolve unknown issues with an innovation idea.  By building a version of the proposed solution, or an aspect of a version, innovators can learn a huge amount about the problem they are trying to solve.   When we learn by doing, we discover things that we don\u2019t even consider when we treat design as a purely analytical problem.  Also, innovators can also learn a huge amount from potential users.  Users have trouble judging something they have not experienced, so you need to give them a prototype to find out what they think, and to stimulate them to provide suggestions.   </p>",
        "<p>This subject addresses the practicalities of building prototypes on behalf of a project sponsor, and validating them with users.  It focuses on four broad subject domains: (1) prototypes \u2013 working out what your prototype should test, designing it, building it, using it to conduct the test, and then iterating it (2) project management \u2013 managing a project without a deterministic outcome, where you go through three rounds of designing and building prototypes, using them to test key hypotheses, capturing your learnings, and then iterating the design, (3) sponsor management \u2013 bringing a project sponsor along on the journey with you so you respond to their needs and they recognise the validity and value of the prototypes you are building, but you complete the project within the available budget (particularly of your time), and (4) communication \u2013 not only will you develop skills to communicate in a way that helps you move the project forward, but you will also learn how to receive and respond to feedback, and how to design and facilitate a workshop of diverse stakeholders.  </p>",
        "<p>The subject has a limited amount of classroom time, and a lot of time working on your project, assisted by a project mentor, being a member of the Faculty, and other students in the subject. Depending on your project a technical mentor may also be required. After you have completed the three rounds of prototyping, each of which may involve one or more prototypes, you will design, facilitate, and write up a workshop in which you present your results and work with key stakeholders work to explore next steps for your project.  You will complete the subject by writing a reflective essay about one key learning from your experience.</p>",
