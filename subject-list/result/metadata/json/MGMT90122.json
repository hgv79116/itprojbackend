    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will introduce students to analytical tools that can be used to solve supply chain problems. These problems will relate to the major drivers of supply chain performance, these being location of facilities, levels of inventory, transportation networks and information exchanges. Typical examples of problems will include: designing the supply chain distribution network; planning demand and supply in a supply chain; and, planning and managing inventories in a supply chain. The analytical tools used to solve each of the problems will be illustrated with their application in computer software packages such as Microsoft Excel. In the discussion of these tools, the managerial context in which they are used and the managerial levers for improvement that they support will be stressed. The design of supply networks, transport optimisation systems and distribution centres will be considered from an analytic perspective.</p>"
