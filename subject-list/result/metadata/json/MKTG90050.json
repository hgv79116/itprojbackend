        "<p>Leading companies understand that <em>how</em> they interact with customers is just as important as <em>what</em> they deliver. Frontline managers face unique challenges at the organisation\u2019s boundary where customer needs and demands may be complex. These managers must be agile to adapt and deploy resources (employees, technologies and customers) to align with dynamic market and customer information.</p>",
        "<p>This subject develops managerial capabilities to facilitate evidence-based decisions and develop innovative strategies to transform customer experiences. Customer experience (CX) leadership focuses on the development of deep understanding and practical capabilities to: (1) inspire and maintain a customer-centric service culture (2) design and orchestrate desirable customer experiences across the entire customer journey; (3) harness technologies (e.g., AI-driven services) for seamless and improved customer experiences; (4) deploy customer metrics to guide experience improvements;  (5) engage frontline employees and mitigate their role stressors; and (6) empower employees for effective service recovery.</p>"
