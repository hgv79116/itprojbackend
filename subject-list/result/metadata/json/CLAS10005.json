        "<p>In this subject students consolidate the basic elements covered in Ancient Greek 1, and are introduced to more complex grammar and syntax, as well as some of the issues involved in interpreting an ancient language. Increasingly difficult texts are read from a variety of sources. By the end of the subject students should have a sufficient grasp of the language to read texts of moderate difficulty with vocabulary assistance. Students who complete this subject may progress to Ancient Greek 3.</p>",
