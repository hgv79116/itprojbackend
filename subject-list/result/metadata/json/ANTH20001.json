    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces a wide range of anthropological interests in the human body from a comparative ethnographic perspective. It explores topics such as body image and eating disorders, trans/gendered bodies, sporting/dancing bodies, body modifications, consciousness and the body/mind continuum, commodified bodies, disabled bodies and body healing. We will investigate how the human body is individually and culturally constructed and socially experienced through a critical examination of a range of ethnographic and theoretical literature, as well as through the student's own bodily experiences and their exploratory field research.<br/><br/></p>"

    "ilo": [
        "Appreciate how a critical comparative perspective and a tradition of ethnographic enquiry can inform developments in theories of the body",
        "Articulate an understanding of a range of debates on the relations between bodies, minds, and the social, cultural and physical environments in which they circulate",
        "Be able to communicate effectively in a variety of written and oral formats",
        "Work reflexively and independently to appreciate the huge diversity of bodies in the world as well as a large (and sometimes challenging) range of beliefs, ideas and experiences people have with bodies and their parts."
