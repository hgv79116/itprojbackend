    "overview": [
        "<p>For an organisation's human resources to translate into a source of competitive advantage it needs to align its strategic capabilities with the design and co-ordination across roles and the sourcing and management of talent to deliver on strategic objectives.  This challenge goes beyond the task of sourcing and recruiting employees with the appropriate skills and aptitudes to competently undertake specific jobs.  This subject focuses on how HR systems architecture can be designed to identify, recruit and engage human resources within strategically important roles that contribute to an organisation's sustainable advantage.  Topics covered in this subject include: HR systems design and strategic alignment, HR differentiation and job design, talent identification and recruitment; managing high performance talent; differentiated performance management and reward strategies, and human capital development strategies.</p>"
