    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject investigates the organisation of the construction industry in various contextual environments, with an emphasis on a socio-ecological approach involving the strategic selection of construction technologies and methods according to specific social, cultural, economic, environmental, legal and technological contexts as well as regional traditions.</p>",
        "<p>Consisting of a seminar component and a travel component (which can vary each year depending on the focus provided by the subject coordinator), the subject will expose students to different cultures, places and people, thus stimulating their ability to reflect critically on the mainstream construction environment of Melbourne.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Approximate Costs:</strong><br/>Flights: $600<br/>Accommodation (8 nights), Food and Local Activities: $400<br/>Local Travel: $500</p>",
        "<p><strong>Note:</strong> Prices listed are subject to change. The costs per student are likely to be $1000 in total. Participating students will receive a one-off subsidy of $500 from the Faculty which will be utilised toward local travel. Students will be expected to contribute $400 to cover food, accommodation and local activities not later than 2 days prior pre-teaching. Students will be required to arrange and pay for the return flight to Cairns.</p>"
