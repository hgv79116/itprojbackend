    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces students to materials science and engineering by developing an understanding of the influence of interatomic bonding and atomic structure on material behaviour. Phase diagrams and equilibria as well as material mechanical, electrical and electro chemical properties will be covered. The process of developing material selection criteria and selecting materials for particular applications will be presented.</p>",
        "<p>Aspects of polymer chemistry will be introduced including the influence of chemical constituents on structure\u2013property relationships. Various types of polymerisation reactions will be covered as well as how to measure the physical properties of the resulting polymers. Physical properties will include, molecular weight, glass transition and melting temperatures, and rheology etc. The design and fabrication techniques for polymer architectures including co-polymers and introduction of crystalline domains will be covered, as well as elastomers and rubbers. A description of polymers in solution as well as polymer melts, chain entanglement and viscoelasticity will be highlighted. </p>",
        "<p>The subject also covers ceramics, including zirconia as a case study. Introduction to brittle fracture including Griffith\u2019s approach, Weibull statistics and toughening mechanisms including phase transformation will be conveyed through the zirconia case study. Carbon based materials including graphene which have exceptional properties including strength and electrical conductivity will be discussed.</p>"
