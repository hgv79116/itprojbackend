    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces students to comparative politics. There are many different aspects of and approaches to comparative politics, but all agree that it involves comparing at least two - and often many more - units of political analysis (e.g. countries, types of political system, electoral systems, areas of policy). The subject is divided into three basic components, each including case studies. The first component introduces the comparative method and classical approaches to comparative politics as we discuss political ideologies and regimes. The second component explores political actors and systems, and the key institutional differences between countries, such as federalism and electoral systems, and their effects. Finally, the course applies the concepts and methods to focus in on key themes and contemporary challenges such as ethnic conflict, state failure, political culture, democratisation and economic development. </p>"
