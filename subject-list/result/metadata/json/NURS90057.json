    "overview": [
        "<p>In this subject, students further develop their knowledge and understanding of unique health issues affecting specific individuals and patient populations cared for across diverse and contemporary practice contexts. The subject explores contemporary models of nursing practice, inter-professional care and primary health care designed to address the health care needs of specific populations. Examples of specific health issues addressed in this subject may include: communicable diseases; men\u2019s and women\u2019s health; child/adolescent health; trauma care; end-of-life care; disaster nursing; refugee health; sexual health; and bariatrics. The contemporary and expanding role of nurses will be explored across diverse contexts such as general practice nursing, community nursing, school nursing, case management and the nurse practitioner.</p>",
        "<p>The subject aims to enable students to develop deeper and broader knowledge about health issues affecting individual patients and their families as they interact with the health care system. Students may engage with the care of patients in any number of settings locally, nationally and in the international context such as:</p>",
        "<p>\u2022 Mental health care</p>",
        "<p>\u2022 Acute/critical care</p>",
        "<p>\u2022 Child, adolescent and family care</p>",
        "<p>\u2022 Older adult care</p>",
        "<p>\u2022 Cancer and palliative care</p>",
        "<p>\u2022 Practice nursing</p>",
        "<p>\u2022 Community nursing</p>",
        "<p>Students will develop specific individualised learning objectives related to their chosen area of practice and to their personally identified learning needs. Throughout the subject, for all students, emphasis will be placed on health assessment for implementing and evaluating physical and psychosocial care across the illness/wellness trajectory and the enhancement of knowledge and skills in therapeutic communication will be promoted. Students will become familiar with interventions required to establish and maintain patient stability, and interventions initiated by nurses at a beginning level of practice will be examined in terms of the research evidence underpinning practice. The ethico/legal aspects of care particularly relevant to the chosen area of engagement will be explored.</p>"
