    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is compulsory for students doing a Master of Epidemiology or a Master of Science \u2013 Epidemiology. The subject covers linear regression methods for continuous outcome variables and logistic regression methods for binary outcome variables. The subject equips students with the practical skills to apply these regression methods to data from epidemiological studies using the statistical package Stata. Also covered is how to adjust for confounding and investigate effect modification using regression models. The focus is on the practical interpretation of the measures of association estimated by these regression models.</p>",
