        "<p>Microbes (viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites and other agents) can be associated with food in several ways:</p>",
        "<ul><li>As components of the fermentation processes that are associated with the development of flavours and textures of food and its preservation</li><li>As the normal microflora that is associated with the origins of the food and persist during storage, possibly contributing to food spoilage</li><li>As contaminants that enter food during processing or through subsequent mishandling, often posing public health risks</li></ul>",
        "<p>However, as foods must be safe and fit for human consumption, this subject aims to familiarise students with major food spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms.</p>",
        "<p>The content will cover:</p>",
        "<ul><li>The kinetics of bacterial growth and the factors that may alter this (water activity, low pH, temperature, preservatives)</li><li>The principles of modelling growth</li><li>The principles of hazard and risk assessment in microbiological safety</li><li>The role of microbes in food processing, including examples of specific fermentation processes and waste treatment</li></ul>",
        "<p>Practical exercises and case studies will be undertaken to provide an in-depth understanding of the regulatory framework of food safety</p>"
