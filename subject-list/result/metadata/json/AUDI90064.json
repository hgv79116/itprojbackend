        "<p>This subject requires students to integrate their audiological knowledge with their clinical and interpersonal skills to further develop and improve their holistic professional performance as they prepare to transition into practice in the community. On completion of the subject, students will have created an e-portfolio that documents their personal, clinical and professional learning. Students will demonstrate growth in reflective practice and critical awareness skills across the year. Students will be able to demonstrate evidence of their understanding and use of evidence-based practice principles.</p>"
