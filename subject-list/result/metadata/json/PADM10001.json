        "<p>Management consulting is one of the great success stories of the last century, and several consultant ideas have shaped the ways in which we live and work today. But how have they done this? Is this a problem? And what do consultants actually do, anyway?</p>",
        "<p>This subject is an introduction to management consulting. It will explore what consultants actually do on a day-to-day basis; the historical and philosophical roots of the industry; and the ways in which their ideas have shaped the global economy. In doing so, it will focus on the functional aspects of consulting work (including different consulting tools and methods), as well as the more political or conceptual (including the relationship between science and management, and the role that consultants play in politics). The subject will specifically unpack the differences between consulting to government, and consulting to the private sector.</p>",
        "<p>The subject will suit those who are interested in pursuing a career in management consulting, or who anticipate needing to regularly work with consultants. It will also appeal to anyone who has a general interest in demystifying this fascinating phenomenon!</p>"
