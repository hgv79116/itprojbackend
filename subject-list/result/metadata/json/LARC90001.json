        "<p>The Placemaking for Landscape is an elective studio. It will establish an interdisciplinary practice-type environment to work with community, traders and Council to design the transformation of an underutilized area in Newport through application of placemaking principles and guidelines. The studio subject site, Market Street to Payne Reserve, has the potential to reconnect and reinvigorate divided public areas, as well as itself providing a valued community space. Using placemaking and design interventions, the studio will address the challenges and opportunities in creating a vibrant community space. The studio will also feed into community processes linking to the Art and Industry Festival to be held in the area in November 2018. The interdisciplinary studio will bring together Landscape Architecture with Architecture and Urban Planning disciplines to apply placemaking, community engagement, urban planning and design thinking.</p>",
        "<p>Note: Classes will be held in the Newport Community Hub, Paine Reserve, Mason St, Newport on 5, 8, 15, 19, 22, 25 January, and 2, 5, 12 February 2018. There will also be student presentations to the local community on 21 February 2018</p>"
