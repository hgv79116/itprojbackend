        "<p>This subject introduces design strategies of Asian gardens and explores the aesthetic values and underlying concepts through lectures, readings and workshops. Gardens in East and South Asia, including China, Japan and Korea, are used as primary cases for investigation, but students can select gardens in other parts of Asia as their case studies for class presentation. After having a fundamental knowledge of design principles of Asian gardens, students will be required to apply those design methods and approaches to formulate creative design responses and generate multiple design outcomes.</p>"
