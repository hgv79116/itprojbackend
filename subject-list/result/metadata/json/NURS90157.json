        "<p>This is a capstone subject in which students will further consolidate and apply the knowledge they have acquired throughout the degree through case-based learning scenarios which feature complex patient health problems.</p>",
        "<p>The capstone experience is in the form of a professional e-portfolio where throughout the academic year and throughout their clinical placement practice students must reflect on their evolving practice within the context of Nursing and Midwifery Registered Nurse Standard of Practice 2018. To support this transition, students also have access to elective subject that would support their interest in particular area of nursing. In the clinical skills laboratory students will refine and consolidate their procedural skills, including basic life support and advanced life support simulations, utilising a self-directed learning approach.</p>",
        "<p>Under the guidance of clinical educators and preceptors, students focus on the transition from nursing student to registered nurse with the goal of achieving readiness to practice as a registered nurse. Through these clinical placements, students have an opportunity to apply knowledge and skills to solve problems that arise in practical settings and professional contexts and develop an integrated understanding of knowledge and practice.</p>"
