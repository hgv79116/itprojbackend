    "overview": [
        "<p>Similar to Critical and Theoretical Studies 5, this subject comprises a series of seminars developed by individual staff dealing with topics and issues in contemporary art theory, aesthetics, criticism and art history.</p>",
        "<p>Each seminar is delivered at a level of conceptualisation that assumes familiarity with the artistic history and critical terminology attained from the previous two years of study. The seminar content reflects particular research initiatives of staff presenting and provides opportunity for students to explore in depth a specific theme that is relevant to contemporary cultural movements and is intellectually innovative in its field.</p>",
        "<p>Critical and Theoretical Studies 6 develops from Critical and Theoretical Studies 1\u20134, introducing more advanced modes of critical interpretation and analysis in the visual arts, and is designed to complement accompanying studio-based programs.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Note: Semester 1 availability is only available to students approved by special permission of the subject coordinator.</strong></p>"
