    "overview": [
        "<p>This research project introduces students to the research culture in the discipline through involvement in a research project in clinical optometry. Students will conduct the project under the supervision of a member of academic staff. In the first few weeks they will perform a literature search and will present an annotated version to their supervisor as a prelude to the development and submission of their research proposal. Students will then be expected to implement methods for collecting, analysing and evaluating data. During the development and data collection phases of the project, students will maintain a diary documenting the research process and reflecting on any logistical and/or ethical issues that arise. The project will culminate with students presenting their research findings as a draft manuscript, in a format suitable for submission for publication. They will also create a video abstract that summarises the basic elements of their research and how their findings relate to practice.</p>"
