    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject extends the theoretical knowledge of paediatric intensive care nursing students have gained by exploring acute and complex illness and injury in the critically ill and/or injured paediatric patient, particularly those requiring high technology care management.  Students will apply knowledge and skills in problem solving, critical thinking and reflective practice to explore the evidence underpinning paediatric intensive care nursing to solve patient management problems encountered in specific intensive care environments. Students will extend their knowledge to assess, plan, manage and evaluate interventions, while developing a deeper understanding and appreciation of patient and family perspectives of illness and disease.<br/><br/></p>"
