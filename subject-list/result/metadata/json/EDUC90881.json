    "overview": [
        "<p>In this subject Teacher Candidates will explore research, theories, and strategies that are useful for examining diversity and inclusion in Australian school classrooms. Teacher Candidates will investigate ways in which schools reinforce and/or challenge the social norms. Furthermore, Candidates will gain knowledge and understanding of physical, social and intellectual development and characteristics of students and how they affect learning.</p>",
        "<p>The subject will also explore the school and the classroom itself with their own dominant systems of values, ideologies and differing relationships of power and authority. Teacher Candidates will examine curriculum and legislative requirements that inform school policy and the development of systems and strategies that support student safety and wellbeing. Inter-personal relationships in schools, classrooms and school communities will also be examined. Teacher Candidates will identify the types of interactions that occur as well as what opportunities for learning and development arise. As part of this subject teacher candidates will understand strategies for working effectively, sensitively and confidentially with parents/carers.</p>"
