        "<p>The 1978 Alma Ata Declaration was a watershed moment in the development of health systems globally. It influenced the evolution of primary health care (PHC) and health practice, especially community and global health. This subject will cover the principles and approaches of community-based PHC with particular focus on the broader influence of PHC across health systems and achieving positive outcomes for all; specifically the most vulnerable and in-need. The core focus of the subject is on the principles of PHC as enshrined in the Alma Ata declaration and how they have been applied in practice with specific emphasis on the evidence for effectiveness and critical review of when, how and whether they should be applied.</p>",
        "<p>Engaging with the history, principles, and key elements of PHC, students will examine the various roles of community health groups, and workers' approaches to disease control; the role of global agencies and local health systems; contemporary applications of the principles of PHC across low, middle, and high-income settings highlighting the need for equitable access; and the current demographic and epidemiological trends PHC is challenged to address.</p>",
        "<p>Drawing on global case studies and experience presented by experts with extensive applied experience, students will acquire a comprehensive understanding of the theory and practice of individual and community participation in PHC, as well as integrated, multi-sectoral and equity-based approaches to achieving improved health. Students will develop the skills and strategies to critically examine PHC approaches and program design, and the current health and health system trends influencing community based PHC globally.</p>",
        "<p>\u2018Primary Health Care: applied principles\u2019 is a dual delivery block mode intensive subject. This means that the assessable material is delivered through self-directed online modules that students complete over a two-week period. The online modules offer flexibility in relation to the timing of when students complete them, or what hours of the day you may choose to study. However, allocated modules should be completed in time to allow effective participation in live interactive sessions that are linked with those modules. Live interactive sessions are held on six days across the two-week period, in which module material is discussed with fellow students and lecturers. Students may choose to attend these live sessions online or face to face. Students are expected to commit approximately 40 hours to learning each teaching week, comprised of learning modules, reading, discussion board activities, group work and live sessions. This two-week teaching period is followed by group work and independent learning towards three pieces of assessment to be completed over six weeks.</p>",
        "<p>This subject is a Melbourne located alternative to POPH90137 \u201cPrimary Health Care in Jamkhed, India\u201d. Students may not take both subjects.</p>"
