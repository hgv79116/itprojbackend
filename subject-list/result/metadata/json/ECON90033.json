        "<p>This course is concerned with the application of quantitative tools to model, estimate and forecast financial variables. Topics considered include: the analysis of the properties of financial data (such as non-normality and non-stationarity); the application of estimation methods (such as unit roots and cointegration) to test the rational valuation model of share prices; the application of the GARCH class of models to estimate volatility and to test the capital asset pricing model.</p>"

        "Analyse recent advances in unit root and cointegration methods in modeling the term structure of interest rates and asset price bubbles;",
        "Describe the strengths and limitations of alternative quantitative methods by reproducing existing results using computer skills and mathematical modeling techniques, in conjunction with a range of financial data sets;",
        "Perform sensitivity analyses on proposed models, which should include the application of alternative distributional specifications to model risk."
