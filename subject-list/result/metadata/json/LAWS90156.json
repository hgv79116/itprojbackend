    "overview": [
        "<p>In an increasingly globalised world, it is no longer enough for lawyers to be familiar with only the law in their jurisdiction. This subject aims to develop a nuanced and sophisticated understanding of family law issues arising in many jurisdictions around the world, grounded in an Australian perspective. Based on a subject taught at the University of Cambridge, core areas of family law will be looked at in a comparative perspective that examines traditional statutory and judicial materials in the context of the specific legal, cultural and social traditions of each jurisdiction. Through this approach, the subject aims to encourage fresh insights on how we think about family law (including options for reform) as it operates in our \u2018home\u2019 jurisdictions, and to deepen our understanding, appreciation and working knowledge of family law as it operates elsewhere. The subject aims to leave students \u2013 including those not intending to practice in family law \u2013 better placed to identify relevant family law problems arising in national and international cases.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
