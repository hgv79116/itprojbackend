    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject allows Fellows in the Atlantic Fellows for Social Equity (AFSE) program to explore contemporary relationships between Indigenous Peoples and settler societies from sociological, political, and social policy perspectives. Adopting a comparative perspective, the subject examines the dynamics of these relationships at national, regional, and global levels, with an emphasis on mechanisms for intervention and reform. It explores the impacts and management of dispossession, Indigenous movements for land rights and self-determination and general movements for reconciliation, enabling comprehensive assessment of the current state of research, policy, and practice.</p>"
