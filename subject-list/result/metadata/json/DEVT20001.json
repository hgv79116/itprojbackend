    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces students to the evolution of multiple paradigms of development, considers the strategies used to pursue development in practice, and identifies the key trends and issues of development in the 21 st century. We examine the theories promulgated about the developing world - of modernization and 'catch-up', of structuralism and dependency, of human development, alternative and post-development. Students will be encouraged to understand the diverse trajectories of development by close analysis of specific case studies across the world. We will explore the development path of countries in Asia, the Pacific, and other parts of the developing world. We also review key issues of relevance to the developing world such as poverty and inequality, health, accountability, religion, and sustainability.</p>"
