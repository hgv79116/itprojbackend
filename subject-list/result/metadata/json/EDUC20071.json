    "overview": [
        "<p>With the transition into new overseas learning environments students abroad usually manage this experience in isolation. Studies have shown that while extended periods of intercultural engagement are important for student development of independence and intercultural communication skills, it is just as important for students to have a framework for analysing their own intercultural interactions. Such frameworks and reflections serve to enhance students\u2019 ability to interact and lead effectively across cultures.</p>",
        "<p> </p>",
        "<p>The aim of this subject is to assist students as they engage in self-reflective practices and exchange these reflections with fellow students online to better understand their overseas learning experiences. Encouraging students to reflect on their overseas learning within a supportive community of peers will promote, facilitate, and support enhanced learning practices for students who participate in this subject. Apart from exchanging information and advice with each other, students will also read and reflect on research that has been conducted by others in this area of studying abroad.</p>",
        "<p> </p>",
        "<p>The delivery of this subject is governed by the differences in locations and time zones students are located in. As such an online discussion forum will be created as analogous to real \u201cclassroom\u201d discussions where questions will be posed and can then be answered by students over the course of a week or so. Students will access these online discussions to reflect on their own experience and by reading the online material provided by the subject coordinator.</p>"
