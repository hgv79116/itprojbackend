        "<p>Critical Communication for Engineers (CCE) addresses the skills vital for professional success. Problem analysis skills and being able to present solutions effectively to your engineering peers, leaders and the broader community are a powerful combination. These are the focus of CCE.</p>",
        "<p>They are challenging skills to learn\u2014and you will likely work to improve them throughout your career. Effective communication is not merely about how to write a report or to give a formal presentation. Developing a strong argument\u2014having something insightful to communicate\u2014is essential for capturing the attention of an audience. This requires developing good interpersonal skills for gathering information and testing ideas.</p>",
        "<p>The subject is divided into four \u2018topics\u2019 presented in sequence through the semester. Each topic is self-contained and dedicated to a different engineering issue. There is an assessment for each topic, meaning that you will be able to apply what you have learned from one topic to the following topics. This way, you will have a lot of opportunities to practise and develop your analytical and communication skills.</p>"
