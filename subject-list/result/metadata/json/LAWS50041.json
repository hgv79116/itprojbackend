    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is designed to examine the nature and structure of international legal argument in historical context and contemporary practice. Part 1 of the subject introduces students to foundational frameworks, concepts, and institutions of international law, and Part 2 considers how those frameworks, concepts, and institutions are drawn on in specific projects and regimes of international law.  Throughout the subject, students will explore historical and current legal disputes involving pressing issues such as climate change, the lawfulness of resort to force, the promotion and protection of human rights, the legitimacy of investor-state dispute settlement, and the tension between national security and freedom of navigation in the law of the sea. The topics addressed in the course will include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>The nature and sources of international law;</li><li>The role and development of customary international law;</li><li>The law of treaties;</li><li>International dispute settlement through the International Court of Justice and investor-state arbitration;</li><li>The subjects of international law;</li><li>Jurisdiction and sovereign immunity;</li><li>State responsibility;</li><li>International law on the use of force;</li><li>International human rights law;</li><li>International environmental law and climate change;</li><li>The law of the sea, and</li><li>The future of international law.</li></ul>",
        "<p>The aim is to acquire an understanding of international law as an argumentative practice that takes place in a field structured by contests between states and other powerful actors, in which a great deal is at stake politically, economically, ideologically, and socially.</p>"
