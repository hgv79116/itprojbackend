    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject articulates and tests the idea of architectural design as a process where cultural and technological decision-making are intertwined. Teaching and learning activities focus on analysing technological means associated with design concepts and evaluating the implementation of alternatives in performance-based design scenarios.</p>",
        "<p>Using examples of past to present architectures, this subject shows and tries to assess design propositions through their technological implementation and vice versa. Topics and practical activities are focused on single-dwelling residential and small to medium scale commercial building typologies.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Costs to students :</strong></p>",
        "<p>Students are required to purchase drawing and/or modelling material. Model making costs are approx. $250 per person, including laser cutting and 3D printing fees.</p>",
        "<p>Prescribed software tools </p>",
        "<p>Drafting software (e.g. McNeel Rhino, AutoCAD)</p>",
        "<p>Image editing software (e.g. <a href=\"https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/\">Affinity Photo</a>)</p>",
        "<p>Layout software (e.g. <a href=\"https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/publisher/\">Affinity Publisher</a>).</p>",
