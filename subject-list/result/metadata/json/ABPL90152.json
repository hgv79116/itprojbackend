    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will introduce the principles for designing and constructing community based infrastructure. It addresses the effects of both sociological and technical issues and discusses affordability, liveability, environmental impacts, sociality and relationships between community networks and space. The first part of the subject addresses these issues on both a theoretical and case study basis while the second part takes this background material \u2018into the field\u2019 to address real life problems via the design studio (and where possible design and construct studios) in Southeast Asia, Papua New Guinea or Australia.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Approximate costs to students:</strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject has fieldwork components that includes travel and accommodation when visiting host communities.
