    "overview": [
        "<p>Biology is the study of life, ranging from simple cells to complex multicellular organisms, and the processes which allow life to exist. Knowledge of the relevant biological concepts is essential for understanding of agricultural theory and practice. This subject aims to introduce the Bachelor of Agriculture students to the importance of the biological sciences in Agriculture and present the key biological processes in an agricultural context. Students will be introduced to a range of concepts vital to understanding the living world, familiarising students with the foundations of cell biology, microbiology, plant and animal systems, evolution and ecology.</p>",
        "<p>This subject will begin with a brief history of Agriculture and will lead on to a discussion of the origin of life, basic molecules of life and how these molecules come together to form living cells. The structure and function of Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic cells will be discussed as will the importance of microbes for soil health and agriculture. These key concepts in evolution, cell biology and soil health, are fundamental to understanding both the biological sciences and how biology underpins agriculture. Plant growth and development will then be introduced. Agriculturally significant crops including Wheat and Soybean will be used to discuss topics ranging from physiological processes such as seed germination, plant growth, transpiration and the transport of substances throughout the plant to metabolic processes such as photosynthesis and respiration. The transition from vegetative to reproductive growth and how pests, disease and environmental factors can affect agricultural production will also be discussed. Animal physiology will be introduced using Agriculturally significant animal species such as cows (ruminants) and pigs (monogastrics). The basic structures, functions and importance of animal biological systems such as the endocrine, respiratory, circulatory and digestive systems will be discussed and factors which influence agricultural production will be emphasized.</p>"
