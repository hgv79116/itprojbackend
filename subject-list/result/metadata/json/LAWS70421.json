    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will examine ways in which law is affecting, and being affected by, the latest advances in medical technology. It will cover a variety of fascinating technologies including genetic, big data analytics, regenerative, therapeutic, artificial intelligence and reproductive technologies. It challenges students to think not only about the future of medicine, but the future of human life itself. Are legal systems dealing with these issues in adequate, legitimate, and strategic ways?</p>",
        "<p>Significantly, the course is not simply for medical lawyers. The syllabus weaves specific technological case-studies with important cross-cutting themes drawn from regulation theory, law reform, and applied philosophy. Those themes are organised so as to provide a framework for critical thinking about regulatory reform and the role of law, lawyers and the medical profession in this process. The themes also impart knowledge and skills relevant to a wide range of industries where law must deal with substantial scientific uncertainty and ethical controversy. Students with interests in privacy, human rights, tort law, IT governance, artificial intelligence, science and technology, family law, and risk regulation are all catered for.</p>",
        "<p>The subject will not be limited to any particular jurisdiction, but focusses on Australian and European law and draws widely on world events. It will be taught by Dr Kathleen Liddell, Director of the Centre for Law, Medicine and Life Sciences (Cambridge) who has more than 20 years\u2019 experience in academia, legal practice, law reform, policy advice and ethical analysis.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Genetic technology, gene editing and personalised medicine</li><li>Human enhancement, cryogenics and other controversial scientific techniques</li><li>Reproductive technologies \u2018old and \u2018new\u2019 including IVF, embryo selection, artificial gametes, womb transplants and ectogenesis</li><li>\u2018Big data\u2019, data analytics, AI and machine-based learning in healthcare</li><li>Future therapeutics</li><li>Regenerative medicine including organ transplants and human stem cell treatments</li><li>Other topical issues that arise while the subject is being taught.</li></ul>",
        "<p>Cross-cutting themes include:</p>",
