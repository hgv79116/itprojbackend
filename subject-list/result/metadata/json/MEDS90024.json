        "<p>The Student Conference will be delivered in a traditional conference format over four days. The aim of the Student Conference is to allow students to learn from each other, experts in various fields and other health professionals in topic areas suited to a conference format. In their fourth and final year, students will attend and participate in the conference program and be actively involved in the conference organisation. Opportunities may exist for students to present or teach, based on the selection of conference themes and their experiences during the first three years of the course. A particular feature of Student Conference 4 will be the presentation of papers and posters reporting projects undertaken in MD Research Project 2.</p>",
        "<p>The attendance requirement is 100%. Students with a genuine need to miss any part of the conference will be able to apply for a Short Leave of Absence.</p>"
