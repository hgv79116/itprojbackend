    "overview": [
        "<p>Underlying the undergraduate design course is the development of both design thinking and dexterity with tools and techniques. The focus of this design subject will be on generating design ideas, translating them into architectural forms, spaces, materials and programs. Students will learn how to refine architecture through consideration of spatial organisation, environmental context and structural necessity. Students will also learn how to communicate comprehensive architectural propositions through 2D- and 3D-modelling (physical and digital), visual and written media and oral presentations.<br/><br/>Methodologies of critical observation, critical inquiry and critical thinking are introduced through a series of short assignments that build on one another and focus on architectural concepts such as form, space, proportion and scale. <br/><br/>The design studio will develop four distinct investigations throughout the semester, touching on a range of design issues and approaches including use of precedent, use of critical analysis in the design process, elements and systems, additive and subtractive geometry manipulation, cultural/artistic transposition and basic generative modelling. This will be produced through iterative processes of production, review, incorporation and resolution.</p>",
