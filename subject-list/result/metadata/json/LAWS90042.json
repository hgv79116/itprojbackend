    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will examine the nature and capacity of international law to accommodate both environment and development objectives. It will explore the meaning of \u2018development\u2019, the legal basis for promoting development, and the ways in which states balance environment and development considerations in international law. The nexus between development and the environment in international law is complex.  International laws protecting the environment have evolved to take account of development considerations. Environmental treaties such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change provide for different commitments from developing and developed countries. Meanwhile, international cooperation fostering development has been shaped by environmental protection. Economic instruments, such as those governing international trade, impact on environmental regulation, and development lending is often linked to environmental performance. The catch-all concept of sustainable development is invoked by states to combine consideration for environmental, economic and social development imperatives leading to contested outcomes.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>The historical evolution of the concept of \u2018sustainable development\u2019 in international law and the crafting of \u2018Sustainable Development Goals\u2019</li><li>A critical appraisal of characterisations of \u2018rights\u2019 to a clean environment and to development in international law</li><li>Case studies demonstrating how international laws to protect the environment take account of development considerations</li><li>Case studies demonstrating how international economic instruments impact on or integrate environmental protection</li><li>A critical assessment of the role of international law in states\u2019 cooperative efforts to balance environment and development objectives.</li></ul>"
