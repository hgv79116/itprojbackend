    "overview": [
        "<p>Students will continue to develop knowledge, skills and attitudes of physiotherapy professional practice. Clinical reasoning and decision making will be learnt in the context of assessment and management of a variety of clinical conditions. Topics including exercise prescription, manual therapy, electrotherapy, soft tissue mobilising and patient education will be introduced using physiotherapy cases. Students will use evidence based outcome measures to identify short and long term treatment goals. They will review current evidence around physiotherapy interventions and build their understanding of current directions in physiotherapy research. Attention will be given to understanding core physiotherapy principles including health ethics, professional practice, physiotherapy culture, critical reflection and lifelong learning. Students will have an opportunity to apply knowledge and skills gained in this subject in a clinical setting.</p>"
