    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides students with a critical understanding of international political economy (IPE), exploring links between international politics and economics in historical and contemporary perspective. It provides an advanced introduction to a range of competing theoretical and methodological approaches in IPE, with an emphasis on their application to current and historical challenges to the governance and politics of the global economy. Major inter-governmental institutions such as the World Trade Organisation, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the G20 are an important focus, as are a range of hybrid international regimes that involve public and private actors. Key historical and contemporary debates in the subject are explored, including divisions between developed and developing countries, the management of trade, international investment, money, and finance in the global economy.</p>"
