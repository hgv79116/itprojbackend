    "overview": [
        "<p>In this subject, students further extend their competencies in writing, reading, speaking and listening by engaging with authentic texts on the theme of \u201cRevolution\u201d. We explore key revolutionary moments in German-speaking societies through contemporary and historical texts, such as songs, speeches, poetry, art and television programs. Students will continue to communicate at a more sophisticated level, developing structures and vocabulary that enable them to express their sensitivity to broader social and cultural themes and their impact upon contemporary German-speaking societies. Students will achieve a moderate level of complexity in speaking, aural comprehension, reading and writing of German and a familiarity with key historical moments in German-speaking societies in the modern era.</p>"
