    "overview": [
        "<p>In mathematical physics, a wealth of information comes from the exact, non-perturbative, solution of quantum models in one-dimension and classical models in two-dimensions. This subject is an introduction to this beautiful and deep subject. Yang-Baxter equations, Bethe ansatz and matrix product techniques are developed in the context of the critical two-dimensional Ising model, dimers, free fermions, the 6-vertex model, percolation, quantum spin chains and the stochastic asymmetric simple exclusion model. The algebraic setting incorporates the quantum groups, and the Temperley-Lieb and braid-monoid algebras.</p>"
