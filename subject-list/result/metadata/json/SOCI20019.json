    "overview": [
        "<p>In an increasingly complex world we need skills that can help us understand the world around us. Qualitative research methods can uncover the nuances of people\u2019s understandings and experiences, and how they make sense of their lives. This subject gives students hands-on skills with these methods, in particular individual interviews and focus groups. Students also become familiar with analytical approaches to analysing qualitative data. Through project-based learning, students will take part in the entire research process from formulating research questions through design, collecting and analysing data and writing up findings. Teaching will be seminar-style and students will work individually and in groups on a collaborative project. The subject will also involve reflections on the practical and ethical challenges involved in doing empirical research and the limitations of research findings.</p>"
