        "<p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is consequential as it is <span>one</span> <span>of the world\u2019s dynamic, large</span> and consequential regional integration arrangements (RIAs). ASEAN is also well plugged into the global value chain and markets, with many of its Member States being leading world traders.<br/><br/>This subject provides an in-depth view on the development of the ASEAN competition regime (policy and law), both at the regional and national levels. In 2015, the ASEAN Leaders declared the establishment of an ASEAN Community, with the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) being one of its three pillars. To realise the objective of the AEC to become a single market and production base, the ASEAN Member States committed to developing, establishing, and implementing robust competition regime.</p>",
        "<p>The subject includes: an exploration of how the ASEAN competition regime is affected by ASEAN being an intergovernmental organisation, <span>which imbues and respects the \u201cASEAN Way\u201d and \u201cASEAN Centrality\u201d concepts.</span> We undertake a comparative analysis on the ASEAN competition regime with other RIAs\u2019 competition regimes \u2013 for example, the challenges and issues in building competition-related institutional arrangements.<br/><br/>We will consider the diversity of ASEAN Member States\u2014 their history, politics, economics, and legal traditions\u2014and how these affect the development of national competition regimes and the priorities of the national competition authorities (NCAs).</p>"
