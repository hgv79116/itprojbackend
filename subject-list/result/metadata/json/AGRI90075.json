    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides students with an introduction to quantitative techniques and strategies used in research in a range of life science disciplines, including agriculture and food science, biological sciences, and ecosystem sciences. The subject will focus on the design of research projects, investigation and interpretation of data, and the application of scientific computing to research problems. Teaching and learning will be centered on hands-on sessions in which students work with real-life data. There is a particular emphasis on developing scientific reasoning, statistical intuition, and experience in the practical application of common quantitative methods.</p>",
        "<p>The subject is designed for students with little or no background in statistics or mathematics.</p>",
        "<p>Topics include:</p>",
