        "<p>Students will undertake an original research project in an area of critical care medicine, gaining an advanced understanding of experimental design and statistical considerations while addressing their own research question and evaluating the research of others.</p>",
        "<p>Students undergo extensive research training with their own individually-supervised research project, acquiring skills in experimental design, technical expertise in clinical and translational research methodologies, critical thinking, analysis, project management and communication.</p>",
        "<p>Being part of a clinical hospital site, students also have the opportunity to learn about the broader significance of research translation as it relates to human health and disease and how research can change and improve the clinical management of patients.</p>"
