    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject supports Teacher Candidates to develop pedagogical content knowledge for the effective teaching and learning of the following mathematics strands from Foundation to Level 7:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Content Strand: Measurement and Geometry</li><li>Proficiencies: Understanding, Fluency, Problem Solving, Reasoning.</li></ul>",
        "<p>Within this content strand, Teacher Candidates will critically analyse the development of key concepts in primary mathematics and identify critical progression points for children\u2019s learning. They will consider typical conceptions and misconceptions held by children, their likely causes, diagnostic tools to diagnose them and teaching strategies for addressing them. Teacher Candidates will review and critique resources for teaching Measurement and Geometry in primary mathematics and examine tasks designed to achieve specific learning outcomes in this strand.</p>",
        "<p>Teacher Candidates will consider research evidence related to select key issues for teaching Measurement and Geometry. They will examine cognitive and affective characteristics of mathematics classrooms that encourage deep learning in these content areas and in the proficiencies.</p>",
        "<p>The links between mathematics and language will be examined, including a focus on strategies and resources for teaching those for whom English is a second language. Teacher Candidates will examine indigenous artwork for evidence of symmetry. They will examine the current Scope and Sequence (Victorian Curriculum: Mathematics) and relate this to various developmental pathways in the primary years.</p>"
