    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces students to cultural policy studies as a distinct domain of cultural studies. It examines the stakes involved in defining and operating within cultural policy studies by working through the characterisations of creative industries, cultural practices, cultural politics and power. Students will analyse specific instances of cultural policy and creative industry developments in Australia, Asia and elsewhere, produce specific studies of the political dimensions of cultural practices in order to re-think perceived notions of identity, ideology and representation, and comprehend the range and consequences of scholarly involvement in cultural policy studies.</p>",
        "<p>Students completing the subject will appreciate the relationship between critical analysis and policy orientation in cultural studies and be familiar with specific instances of cultural policy, creative industry and cultural citizenship development at local, state, federal and international levels.</p>"
