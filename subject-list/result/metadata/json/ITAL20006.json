        "<p>This intensive three-week study abroad subject will be taught in Venice between the end of November and December and focuses on the social and cultural spaces of Venice (real, imaginary, or interpreted): how these spaces were used, represented, and understood in early modern Venice.</p>",
        "<p>The subject will also explore how these private and public spaces were used in the early modern production of communication, information, and culture.</p>",
        "<p>Field trips to several sites and museums will provide students with the basic skills needed to work on fifteenth-century primary sources. On completion of this subject, students should have acquired an understanding of the use of languages and places in early modern Venice. Students will also be able to gain a basic knowledge of production and reception of culture and communication in early modern Venice and Europe.</p>"
