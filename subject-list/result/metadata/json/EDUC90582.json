    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject builds on EDUC90580 <em>Evidence Based Learning &amp; Teaching 1</em>, providing participants with opportunities to develop knowledge and understanding related to student learning and achievement. Participants further explore the contribution of learning theories and review them using an evidence-based approach.</p>",
        "<p>This subject provides opportunities for participants to develop an in-depth understanding of student assessment, in particular the significance of making accurate judgments of students\u2019 readiness to learn. It focuses on key teacher skills and capacities: designing evidence based developmental learning progressions that are linked to curriculum outcomes; designing assessment tasks to locate students on a developmental learning progression; interpreting and analysing formal and informal evidence of student learning to determine readiness to learn; planning for learning, based on an understanding of student\u2019s readiness to learn; exploring implications for pedagogical practices and classroom organization; and evaluating the effectiveness of assessment tasks and teaching strategies.</p>",
        "<p>This subject, along with the EDUC90594 <em>Developing Clinical Practice 2</em> and EDUC90844 <em>Learning Area B2</em>, requires participants to implement the <em>Clinical Praxis Project</em>. <em>The </em>Clinical Praxis Project will extend on learning from the Clinical Praxis Exam in year 1, by enabling participants to focus on the class as a whole and provide differentiated or structured teaching and learning opportunities for all students in the class.</p>"
