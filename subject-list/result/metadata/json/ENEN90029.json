    "overview": [
        "<p><strong>AIMS</strong><br/><br/>In this subject students will learn about the fundamentals of water quality and the associated standards for use as potable water, recycled water or discharge into the environment in a sustainable manner. The subject will include the identification of risks and measures to control those risks and various treatment processes including physical, chemical and microbiological treatment of water and wastewater. The concept of integrated water management will be introduced and reinforced in the group based project work throughout the semester. Students will learn about the systems for water reclamation and reuse. This subject builds on a range of student\u2019s general knowledge of water systems engineering that is developed in subjects like Systems Modelling and Design and builds on general knowledge of chemistry and biology. It is also assumed that students have developed skills on identifying and sourcing information, and can effectively work as a team to solve larger problems.<br/><br/>Graduates from this subject may apply the skills developed in the water supply, waste water treatment, or water sensitive urban design areas.<br/><br/><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT</strong><br/><br/>This subject covers theoretical and practical management aspects of sustainable water supply and treatment, wastewater treatment and reuse. Specific topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Integrated water management</li><li>Risk identification and management for water services</li><li>Water quality guidelines, regulations and performance criteria for treatment plant design</li><li>Water treatment processes and waste disposal</li><li>Wastewater treatment - physical, chemical and biological treatment technologies</li><li>Systems for water reclamation and reuse.</li></ul>",
        "<p><br/>The students will produce a conceptual design of a water and wastewater treatment system for a small town.</p>"
