    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject integrates the knowledge and skills gained in Nursing Science 1 &amp; 2, Nursing Assessment &amp; Care, and Clients with Acute &amp; Chronic Illness. Students will develop skills that focus on processes of nursing care necessary for patients experiencing complex health problems. The aim of this subject is to consolidate, reinforce and expand previously learnt skills in assessment, data collection, problem identification and the selection of relevant nursing interventions. The role of nurses in collaborating with allied disciplines to deliver health care to clients with complex health issues will be discussed. Care of the patient with invasive lines and attachments, complex pain issues and multiple medications will be explored.</p>",
        "<p>In the <strong><em>simulated learning laboratory</em></strong> students will practice the procedural skills necessary for care of complex patients including venepuncture, blood transfusion, central venous catheters, management of the artificial airway and underwater seal drainage. Students will develop skills in the identification and interpretation of abnormal arrhythmias and cardiac monitoring.</p>",
        "<p>During the <strong><em>professional experience placement, </em></strong>under the guidance of clinical educators and clinical mentors, students will gain experience in settings that enable them to meet the learning objectives of this subject.</p>",
        "<p>The major focus for the professional experience practicum component of this subject is integration of the principles for holistic nursing, clinical decision making and more complex and advanced nursing interventions. On completion of the subject it is expected that students, while providing therapeutic interventions, are able to incorporate the collection of health assessment data, identify actual and potential patient problems, plan care with the selection of appropriate nursing interventions, implement interventions and evaluate the outcome of nursing care accordingly for 3 to 4 patients.</p>"
