    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will introduce students to the principles of genomic variant classification, interpretation and reporting in a clinical setting.  Students will apply these principles together with foundational concepts of human genetics and genomics to model clinical practice using examples from specialised areas of clinical genomics. </p>",
        "<p>The intended learning outcomes for this subject are in accordance with the Human Genetics Society of Australasia\u2019s core competencies for training in genetic counselling. The subject will be delivered via a combination of asynchronous on-line content and synchronous tutorials that adopt a problem-based approach to meet the intended learning outcomes.</p>",
