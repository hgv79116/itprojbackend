    "overview": [
        "<p>The overall aim of Principles of Clinical Practice 2 is to further develop applied biomedical knowledge, key clinical skills, and clinical reasoning in a full-time clinical environment. Students are expected to actively participate in a variety of different learning activities both online and in person, and to actively engage in clinical placement. The subject will be delivered in four-week terms. Over the course of the year students will be on clinical placement in adult medicine, surgery, anaesthesia, and emergency and will focus on becoming part of hospital-based teams to help them develop their diagnostic and therapeutic skills in the context of the patients presenting with acute and chronic medical and surgical conditions. Teaching activities include interactive modules that allow students to apply biomedical knowledge, clinical skills and clinical reasoning to develop a differential diagnosis and provide a management plan on core conditions and presentations; simulation exercises focused on the deteriorating patient; intensive clinical skills coaching, oral presentations of patient assessment findings and professional practice development.   </p>"
