    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is the Capstone subject in the Japanese Studies major of the Bachelor of Arts. It will give students majoring in Japanese Studies the opportunity to draw together the threads of their undergraduate Japanese language studies into a distinctive and culminating combined disciplinary and cohort experience before graduating. The subject aims to consolidate, integrate, and extend the content and skills acquisition components of Japanese Studies, and will prompt students to apply those skills and knowledge in the capstone experience, thus serving as a bridge between the undergraduate experience and the next stage of study or work. </p>",
        "<p>In this subject, students will devise their own research topics, from planning, design, execution and dissemination. In the process, students will need to exercise creativity in examining, problematising, critiquing and considering novel, creative approaches to contemporary issues in the context of global Japanese language, society and culture. The experience will culminate in a final showcasing of students' projects in an event open to all students of the Japanese Studies Program, the Asia Institute and the University of Melbourne as a whole. This event will provide a platform for disseminating findings, as well as the framework for celebrating students' achievements. </p>"
