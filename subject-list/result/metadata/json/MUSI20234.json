    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces instrumentalists and singers to the practice of musical improvisation. Through practical activities in workshop-style lectures, students explore musical improvisation in solo and group contexts through demonstrations, deep listening exercises and challenging performance tasks. </p>",
        "<p>Tailored to suit their instrument or voice, these activities guide students in acquiring tools and strategies for improvising across diverse musical styles, enhancing their regular performance practice, strengthening their aural connection to an instrument or voice, and encouraging creative courage through spontaneity.</p>",
        "<p>This subject is designed for music students who have traditionally focused on performing notated music. No prior experience in improvisation is required.</p>",
        "<p><strong><em>This subject is available for enrolment to students in all the Bachelor of Music majors except Jazz and Improvisation Major.</em></strong></p>"
