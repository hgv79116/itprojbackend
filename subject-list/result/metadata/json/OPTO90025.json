        "<p>Note: This subject is only available to students enrolled in the Doctor of Optometry.</p>",
        "<p>This second year Doctor of Optometry capstone subject aims to provide an authentic research experience in the discipline by involvement in an investigation in vision science and/or optometry under the supervision of a member of the academic staff. The project will usually involve an in-depth appraisal of the scientific literature and, as appropriate to the topic, the use of biochemical, molecular biological, pharmacological, neurophysiological, psychophysical, computational, epidemiological or advanced clinical techniques. The practical component of the project will typically involve experimental work on humans or animals and will usually be undertaken as a collaborative team effort. The team will develop a research proposal (summarising the relevant literature, aims, methods and timeline), conduct the experiments, analyse the data and present the project outcomes as a poster in a conference setting. Individual students will build on the team\u2019s work to prepare their own manuscript that is in a format suitable for publication in a journal.</p>"
