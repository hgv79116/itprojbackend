        "<p>Exploration of non-Australian texts gives students the opportunity to integrate dialect and character work as students will develop transformational skills that extend physical and vocal technique beyond habitual and familiar choices.</p>",
        "<p>Students undertake rehearsal processes and exercises adapting to different directing approaches while continuing to develop their own artistic voice. In applying technical skills to rehearsal and performance tasks, students further extend their knowledge of an integrated actor\u2019s process.</p>"
