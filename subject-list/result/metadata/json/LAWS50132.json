        "<p>Across jurisdictions, debates on the appropriate legal response to the demands of culture and religion are growing in importance. These debates are set against the background of contemporary controversies around cultural drug use, religious dress (e.g. the burka), claims for special language rights, religious animal slaughter, religious arbitration or mediation and the rights of indigenous peoples. This course will explore these debates through the following questions, among others:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Is the legal protection of religious freedom justified? What should the scope of such protection be?</li><li>What demands does multiculturalism make on the law? Is multiculturalism bad for women? How should the law respond to multiculturalism?</li><li>How should the law respond to demands for exemptions from general laws for cultural or religious reasons?</li><li>How should the law respond to demands for the accommodation of religious and cultural norms within state legal systems?</li><li>How should the law respond to religious or cultural practices that have a far-reaching impact on children?</li></ul>",
        "<p>We will explore further controversies (e.g. the legal recognition of polygamy and polyamory) and different jurisdictions (e.g. the personal law system in India) of interest to students in the final seminars.</p>"
