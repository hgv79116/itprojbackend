        "<p>In this subject, students will advance their learning about the computational algorithms in engineering. Students will learn about data structures necessary for the construction of efficient algorithms, such as linked-lists, stacks, trees and graphs.  Students will spend a majority of the subject learning about algorithms useful in solving engineering problems, such as search, insertion, deletion, sorting, random access with arrays and indices, shortest path search algorithms (Dijkstra's), Knapsack problem and numerical optimal control (Dynamic Programming).  Students are also introduced to some optimisation algorithms.  The concepts introduced will be reinforced through a contextual engineering project with Mechatronics focus.</p>"
