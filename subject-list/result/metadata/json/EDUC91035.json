    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject explores the content and pedagogical content knowledge needed to teach the <em>Measurement and Geometry</em> strand in Years 7-10 mathematics. Participants will study research on students\u2019 mathematical thinking and effective teaching methods, analyse major teaching resources and develop pedagogical use of technologies, including dynamic geometry and applets.</p>",
        "<p>Development of the proficiencies of fluency, understanding, reasoning and problem solving will be considered in the context of <em>Geometry</em>. Strategies for engaging students in mathematics and developing a productive disposition will be considered. Approaches for planning learning sequences and lessons in <em>Measurement and Geometry</em>, including selection and use of appropriate resources will be addressed. Practical teaching tasks will complement theory.</p>"
