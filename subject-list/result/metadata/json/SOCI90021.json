        "<p>Subtitle: Families and Citizenship Through an Intersectional Lens</p>",
        "<p>Feminist Social Policy takes a comparative and critical approach to understanding and evaluating social policy and policy-making at a national and international level. This subject aims to critically explore normative assumptions about what constitutes the family, parenthood, youth, marriage, disability, child and elder care. Students in this subject will be encouraged to broaden and deepen their understanding of how social policy is organised and impacted by these social, cultural, economic and political normativities by drawing on contemporary theories of intersectionality and citizenship. Taking a feminist perspective, this subject will outline key shifts in women\u2019s employment trends, de/familization, blended and chosen families, global fertility rates, disability rights, and welfare provision. Students will have the opportunity to explore themes of intersectionality and citizenship throughout their engagement with the subject, as well as articulate a comparative analysis of social policy from across the world.</p>"
