    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject examines the implementation of programs and policies designed to promote social inclusion and equity. It considers how practices, across a range of educational settings, respond to social diversity, and it examines the barriers as well as the opportunities for achieving more equitable and inclusive educational participation and experiences. Structural categories and social patterns of difference are analysed alongside individual or group experiences of inclusion/exclusion. Students will be encouraged to draw on their own professional and educational experiences as an initial basis to investigate diversity and social inclusion. The subject combines overview of current research and policy with case studies of particular workplace and educational initiatives. Topics covered include: diversity and inclusion in the workplace, in higher education, in early childhood, in secondary and primary schooling; disability; social exclusion; race and ethnicity; gender; socio-economic leadership and institutional change; educational reform; international trends in diversity and inclusion policies.</p>"
