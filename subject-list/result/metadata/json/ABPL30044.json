    "overview": [
        "<p>This capstone subject brings together and builds on an understanding of construction technologies and introduces project management concepts. Using an integrated project involving a series of studio-based exercises, students will translate a design proposal into operational construction and project management plans. A project based learning environment will be formulated for students to experience construction and project management decision making from concept through to completion. Details of project environment, construction systems, resource constraints, production processes, and management tools and methods will be explored and efficient project plans will be developed.<br/><br/> In this capstone subject,  students will form teams and work on assigned projects appropriately selected from the industry. Different roles in the project will be played by the teams. For example, the tenderers are to prepare a project development proposal based on the requirements of the client and then develop operational plans to implement the project. To accomplish this, the tenderers need to plan the construction project based on the development proposal, clients\u2019 requirements and resources available. They are to estimate and evaluate activity durations, simulate and adjust construction sequences and balance resources involved. In developing the construction plan, alternative construction systems and methods will be examined and compared. Essential elements of the plan include construction equipment, temporary works and site layout. Site safety is an integral part of the plan.<br/><br/>The planning processes will be assisted by introducing commercial computer applications.</p>"
