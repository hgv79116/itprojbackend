    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is designed to develop an understanding of the links between contemporary public policy and political communication and lobbying processes, in particular how the political and media environment can be utilised to transform the public policy agendas of interest groups and NGOs into concrete political and legislative outcomes. In a world of increasingly short-term media cycles and fragmented audiences, developers of public policy can no longer rely just on the quality and integrity of their ideas and recommendations to attract and maintain broad-based support. Instead, contemporary public policy is becoming increasingly reliant on \u2018campaign style\u2019 forms of political lobbying to achieve community influence as well as traction among government decision-makers. The subject explores the theory and research behind these changes, in particular why certain interest groups and sectors are able to position themselves for public policy success compared to others. The subject gives specific attention to ways to develop and advance public policy through a prism of \u2018campaign-style\u2019 political communications and lobbying. These techniques include how to develop public policy narratives that align with the interests of policy and political decision-makers; how to use evidence-based research to build a case for change; forming third-party coalitions to build broad-based support, as well as the use of strategic media to project the benefits of public policy change. The subject\u2019s specific focus is on public policy lobbying campaigns that have occurred or are occurring within the Australian political and public policy environment but its themes and approaches are equally applicable to other contemporary political systems.</p>"
