        "<p><strong>AIMS</strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject focuses on business analysis from the context of digital technologies. It introduces modern business analysis techniques, including a selection of those in the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge (BABOK) by the International Institute of Business Analysis (IIBA), and exemplifies them by means of digital technologies applied to solve problems or exploit new business opportunities. It also includes in-depth case studies in which business problems and opportunities, drawn from real-world scenarios, are mapped to digital solutions. The work is summarised in seven guiding principles that should be followed by every business analyst.</p>",
        "<p><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT</strong></p>",
        "<p>Topics include methods, techniques and tools for requirements elicitation, business analysis planning and monitoring, stakeholders engagement planning, business needs identification, business process identification and modelling, change strategy definition, and the design, delivery and evaluation of information systems solutions to business problems.</p>",
        "<p>Examples of projects that students complete are:</p>",
        "<ul><li>A report focussing on the information gathering and modelling of a business problem.</li><li>A comprehensive report covering all aspects related to the analysis of a business problem and the design, delivery and evaluation of an information systems solution to this problem.</li></ul>"
