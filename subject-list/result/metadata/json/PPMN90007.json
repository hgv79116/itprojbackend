    "overview": [
        "<p>This compulsory subject in the Master of Public Policy and Management will provide students with the key theoretical and analytical perspectives and debates in public policy. Students will be introduced to key competing theoretical models explaining policy design and implementation processes. We will explore how policy problems are identified, framed and contested; examine the influence of local and global actors and institutions; and discuss roles that ideas, evidence, and norms play in the design process. As well as exposing students to key theoretical models, case study analysis and practice-based assessment tasks will be used to develop student\u2019s hands-on skills in policy analysis and design.</p>"
