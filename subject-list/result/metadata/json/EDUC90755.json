    "overview": [
        "<p>The major focus of this course is how school leaders know that teachers and students are learning in positive ways throughout their school. Students will explore the current evidence base about what works best, what criteria can be developed to make decisions about success, how to develop a program logic for their leadership role, and how to evaluate the impacts of leadership decisions on both teachers\u2019 and students\u2019 learning. This subject aligns with the Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership National Professional Standard for Principals.</p>"
