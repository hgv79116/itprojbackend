        "<p>In this subject students will have the opportunity to undertake a small clinical research investigation in an area of clinical interest. In consultation with a research supervisor and/or the course coordinator, participants will formulate a research question and undertake a systematic or literature review to evaluate the published evidence to synthesize an answer to their research question. This subject will provide participants with the practical knowledge required to plan an evidence based clinical research project with consideration given to the process and requirements of ethics approval.</p>"
