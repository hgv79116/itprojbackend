    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject offers an advanced introduction to the Anthropology of Development, covering key issues, theories and debates. The subject will focus on ways in which anthropological approaches can contribute to understandings of Development and to improved Development practices and outcomes. Starting with an overview of anthropology's history of engagement with Development, the subject will explore: anthropological critiques of Development culture, assumptions, models and policies; key ideas and theoretical approaches in the Anthropology of Development; and the efforts of anthropologists to place the experiences and viewpoints of ordinary people in sites of Development at the centre of Development research and practice. Students in this subject will also learn about anthropological approaches to key Development issues in the contemporary world, such as: the developmental state and society; \u2018pro-poor\u2019 approaches, participation and empowerment; contemporary systems of transnational capitalism; and international development agencies and the socio-cultural worlds of aid professionals. The Anthropology of Development explores these topics through a range of ethnographic case studies from different developing countries and development contexts across the world.</p>"
