    "overview": [
        "<p>Following on from Orthodontics 2 this subject focuses on developing to specialist level all aspects of orthodontic treatment and inter-disciplinary management of patients with paediatric dental, periodontic, prosthodontic, endodontic and oral and maxillofacial surgery units at the Royal Melbourne (RMH) and Royal Children\u2019s (RCH) Hospitals. Further clinical training continues to be undertaken at the Royal Dental Hospital of Melbourne and the Melbourne Dental Clinic with all clinical training sessions being under the supervision of experienced orthodontists. A student will actively engage with members of the surgical teams at RMH and RCH by attending regular meetings and interdisciplinary clinical sessions, and continue with regularly scheduled interdisciplinary meetings within the Dental School.</p>",
        "<p>All students attend weekly diagnosis and treatment planning sessions of student and unseen cases which foster collegiate interaction and friendly debate on treatment options.</p>",
        "<p>Formal seminars and literature review sessions occur for approximately 36 weeks a year delivered in 2-3 hour sessions. The seminars and literature reviews are designed to cover subject areas outlined by the US ADA Commission on Dental Accreditation (and examined by the American Board of Orthodontics).</p>",
        "<p>DDS Teaching Requirement<br/>All students are required to conduct seminars for the Doctor of Dental Surgery students, approximately 24 hours annually. This is undertaken in the second half of each year.</p>"
