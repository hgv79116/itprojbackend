    "overview": [
        "<p>Learning Area subjects assist participants to develop both the knowledge base and the skills of professional practice to enable them to effectively educate all students in their specific learning areas and to work effectively within school contexts. <br/><br/>Participants are supported to develop knowledge and skills related to curriculum content, best practice pedagogy and assessment in their specific teaching areas. They are encouraged to adapt and apply this knowledge according to the needs of their learning community and to link their classroom practice to key theory and research into the effective teaching of their subject areas. <br/><br/>Particular attention will be paid to developing familiarity with relevant curriculum standards and frameworks. Participants will be expected to use an evidence-base to inform their planning and sequencing of lessons, in the creation of units of work and in the use of a broad range of teaching strategies and tools, including the use of ICT.<br/><br/>In these subjects participants learn to use multiple assessment processes as evidence of student learning, to differentiate their teaching in order to facilitate all students\u2019 progress and as feedback on the effectiveness of their teaching. Participants are supported to become critical, informed members of the school community who are able to reflect on their school\u2019s curriculum policies and provision as well as the resources and infrastructure available for their Learning Areas.</p>"
