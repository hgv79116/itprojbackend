        "<p>Students will be assigned to a Practicum Organisation where they will work in teams to undertake a significant business consulting activity. Students will need to work with the Practicum Organisation in order to develop a solid statement of work, which the project will be expected to deliver to. Students will learn to work with unstructured and incomplete information, to develop research and networks to support their enquiry, to work successfully in teams, and to present their findings and seek and receive constructive feedback in a range of settings. Students will also be encouraged to plan, reflect and modify their approaches to improve the outcomes of their efforts in managing their business consulting project. Students will be supported in this consulting project with seminars on the consulting process, staged deliverables which facilitate solid project management techniques and input from the course co-ordinator.</p>"
