    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject builds on students\u2019 understanding of tort law and its alternatives, and in so doing exposes them to the practice of law on behalf of plaintiffs severely injured - perhaps in the workplace or in motor vehicle accidents. The doctrinal focus of the subject will be on personal injury compensation schemes. Students will ply and develop their statutory interpretation skills in learning how personal injury compensation regimes have been implemented \u2013 both through complaint and resolution before the courts. With a solid grounding in compensation schemes, students will progress to discuss how to use these areas of law for clients severely injured in accidents. Students will be exposed to theoretical, practical and experiential appraisals of client centred lawyering, the acquisition and presentation of expert evidence, and the process and resolution of compensation claims. In this sense, the subject presents modules that enable students to learning the law and to learning about the practice of the law.</p>"
