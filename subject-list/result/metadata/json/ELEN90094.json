        "<p>This course provides an introduction to an important contemporary statistical toolset for applications including data science, machine learning, signal processing, financial engineering, biomedical engineering, communication systems and other high-dimensional statistical applications. The course will cover topics including introduction to random matrix theory models in engineering; eigenvalue distributions; finite-dimensional and large-dimensional techniques, covariance estimation, principal component analysis and spectral clustering. These topics will be supplemented by applications across a range of traditional and emerging domains involving big data sets. </p>",
