        "<p>Within the workshop, students will be encouraged to explore their own work and utilise a selection of techniques by engaging with ideas of repetition, difference, and variation.</p>",
        "<p>This subject is designed to explore printmaking processes and technology as a vehicle for imaging ideas and image production, as well as to motivate and involve students in analytical thinking about visual perception. It also includes an induction into the Printmaking workshop, with an emphasis on Occupational Health &amp; Safety.</p>"
