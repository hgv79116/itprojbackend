    "overview": [
        "<p>Current approaches to business emphasize the importance of adopting a consumer focus. At its essence, marketing\u2014and business more broadly\u2014is an attempt to influence consumer behaviour. This subject seeks to provide insights into consumer psychology as a basis for developing powerful consumer-influence tactics and marketing strategies.</p>",
        "<p>While all of us are consumers, our intuitions about our own behaviour, as well as that of others, are often inaccurate. Understanding our consumers\u2014or ourselves, as consumers\u2014is no easy task. A solid understanding of cognitive and social psychology can offer insight beyond business acumen and help guide a plethora of business decisions.</p>",
        "<p>In this course you will learn about fundamental theories and concepts in consumer psychology and about new research findings to enhance your understanding of how and why people choose, use, and evaluate goods and services the way they do.</p>"
