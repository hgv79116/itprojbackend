        "<p>This subject is the first in a series of three Research and Evidence subjects that will be delivered over the three year course duration. Specifically these subjects will focus on research as it applies to physiotherapy and the process of evidence based practice. Research and Evidence 1 will target the following foundations of research:</p>",
        "<ol><li>Principles of evidence based practice;</li><li>Concepts of measurement;</li><li>Ethics of clinical human research;</li><li>Descriptive statistics and introduction to epidemiology.</li></ol>",
        "<p>Research principles taught in this subject will be integrated and implemented into concurrent and subsequent first year subjects in the Doctor of Physiotherapy. For example, concepts of measurement taught in this subject will be the basis of the measurement tools studied in the concurrent subject Physiotherapy Theory and Practice 1.</p>"
