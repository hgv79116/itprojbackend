    "overview": [
        "<p>The subject will focus on establishing foundational knowledge in biology and building on this to provide students with a thorough understanding of key concepts. It explores the diversity and unity of life through the lens of five core concepts: evolution, cell theory, regulation, transmission of information and interconnectedness in biological systems. These concepts will be studied at the molecular, cellular, and individual level, including the evolution of life from the abiotic to the individual, the molecular and physical structure of the cell, cell replication and gene expression, homeostasis, photosynthesis and respiration, and interactions within and between organisms.</p>"
