    "overview": [
        "<p><strong>Business Foundations</strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject provides students with a foundation that is essential to be an effective business executive. After completing this subject, students will have a clear understanding of the key areas that need to be managed effectively for a business to be successful, specifically leading and managing people, growing demand, managing operations, and managing financial sustainability. Students will acquire many useful skills and techniques that will help them effectively manage those key areas. This subject will also provide students with essential skills for successfully completing more advanced subjects in the MBA program, which cover many more advanced topics that will help students become a better business leader.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Leadership</strong></p>",
        "<p>Organizations face many adaptive challenges to survive and thrive in a context of a complex and uncertain environment driven by forces such as globalization and technology. Managers maintain the status quo efficiently but leaders help individuals, teams, organizations, and societies to do adaptive work. Leadership is not a position but a process and it is often emergent and shared by individuals who choose to be leaders and have developed leadership capability. Leadership is particularly important in new organization structures that are flat, flexible, diverse, and global rather than hierarchical, stable, and homogenous. There is substantial evidence that leadership can be learned, and this introductory subject is aimed at developing the capability to lead individuals and teams through intrapersonal (i.e., self\u2010awareness and self\u2010management) and interpersonal (i.e., social awareness and social skill) development. This subject includes theoretical and conceptual content alongside solo and group exercises designed to prepare students for leadership experiences in the MBA program and their future careers.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Data Analytics</strong></p>",
        "<p>Contemporary business is awash in data. Modern business processes and activities usually involve multiple streams of data from areas as diverse as marketing activities, operational processes and financial activities. Therefore, managers are frequently confronted with how to harness these to understand their business better, so that they can make more informed decisions. This subject provides the fundamental quantitative skills necessary for an MBA student to extract information from data, through quantitative analysis, to make better managerial decisions. Students will be familiarized with the tools of quantitative analysis, develop the necessary skills for analytical thinking and a quantitative mind set in measuring performance. The fundamental quantitative skills from this subject provide a foundation to the advanced subjects within the MBA and provide students an analytical framework towards solving managerial problems in their career.</p>",
        "<p><strong>People Management</strong></p>",
        "<p>The course examines human behaviour at the individual, group and organisational levels. Theories, models and research will be discussed and applied through case studies, syndicate team assignments, experiential exercises and reflection on work experience. Each topic has been selected to help you better manage yourself, other people, groups and organisations.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Economics for Managers</strong></p>",
        "<p>Economics for Managers is designed to provide you with the tools of economic reasoning for developing and evaluating strategic business options and to make better choices. To this end we discuss and develop the fundamental economic concepts and analytical skills required in managerial and strategic decision-making. Applications lie in bargaining, price setting, the analysis of different market environments, and the analysis of situations with asymmetric information. Many subjects\u2014and in particular business strategy, finance, marketing, and negotiations\u2014build upon the material learned in Economics for Managers.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Personal Effectiveness 1</strong></p>",
        "<p>The \u201cPersonal Effectiveness Program\u201d (PEP) runs across the two core modules and is designed to help students develop the skills and knowledge required to effectively manage the early stages of their career. PEP identifies specific needs of each individual student and then provides ongoing support, training, and opportunities to practice and perfect these skills. PEP focuses on three core areas.</p>",
        "<ol><li>Communication skills: These skills include effective presentations, verbal communication, written communication, and public speaking</li><li>Career development skills: These skills include case practice, interview skills, CV writing, networking, and business etiquette</li><li>Team skills: These skills include managing conflict, cultural awareness, giving and receiving feedback, and resilience.</li></ol>"
