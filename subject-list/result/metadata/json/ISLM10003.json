        "<p>Today, approximately 24% of the world\u2019s population is Muslim. What is Islam, and how does it shape our world: historically, culturally, economically, and politically? What binds nearly 2 billion Muslims together: how are Muslims \u2018Muslim\u2019, but differently? <br/>This subject introduces students to the religion of Islam and explores its major beliefs, sacred texts, and diverse cultural manifestations, and considers how these influence the lives of Muslims, Muslim societies, and the world today. Focusing on the diversity that exists within Islam, and among Muslims, each lecture begins with a question or challenge that is relevant today. Examples of topics covered include the emergence of Islam, Prophet Muhammad, the Qur\u2019an, Sharia and law, Sunnis and Shia, Sufis and spirituality, money and charity, gender and equality, relations with people of other faiths, and jihad. The subject also considers both Muslim-majority and Muslim-minority contexts and examines the lessons they hold for a world grappling with cultural diversity.</p>"
