        "<p>The 8 80 Cities concept suggests that cities designed for the needs of 8 and 80 year olds work for all ages. In addition, communities benefit from facilities that are located, configured and shared in symbiotic ways.</p>",
        "<p>In this intensive students will interact with an inner-city council and other professionals to imagine an age friendly future where design for diversity is embedded into every neighbourhood.</p>",
        "<p>The studio is open to students of architecture, urban design, landscape architecture and planning, who will work together to address challenges which no one discipline can easily answer:</p>",
        "<ul><li>How do we decide the optimal density and mix of development for a precinct?</li><li>Can design help to build community and enable ageing in place?</li></ul>",
        "<p>This intensive explores the benefits of diversity \u2013 mixed uses, demographics, typologies, scales, characters, ownership, development processes and design teams. At its heart is the opportunity to engage with real inner-city situations.</p>",
        "<p>The format in the first fortnight will typically consist of tutorials and presentations from expert practitioners each morning followed by independent and group work each afternoon. There will then be a week to finalise propositions and present the work.</p>",
        "<p>The first week will be research-focused, with students working in multidisciplinary groups to generate insightful analyses. Each student will then develop individual propositions specific to his or her discipline.</p>"
