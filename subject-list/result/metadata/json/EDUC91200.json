    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will consider how educators can better understand ways in which people with neurodevelopmental conditions and those identifying as neurodivergent interact and experience the world, and how that impacts on learning, wellbeing and inclusion. Qualities of neurodiversity that will be covered include autism spectrum\u202fconditions, intellectual disability, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, as well as common comorbidities.</p>",
        "<p>The subject combines research and theory from neuroscience, education, psychology, and sociology, to create a multidisciplinary evidence-base aligned with the science of learning. It will combine this research and theory with tiered and strength-based models of intervention. This subject will develop skills that will lead to understanding how to implement sustainable and naturalistic interventions tailored to diverse learners that are responsive, inclusive and evidence based.</p>"
