        "<p>This subject offers an anthropological perspective to understandings of gender and sexuality, providing an empirical, cross-cultural framework with which to examine various theoretical frameworks. It embraces a historical perspective to disciplinary knowledge and evaluates the central role of anthropology\u2019s distinct research method in shaping representations of gender, sexuality, and cultural diversity in the world today.</p>",
