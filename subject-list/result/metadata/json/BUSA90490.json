        "<p>This subject is intended as an \u2018integrative\u2019 capstone course, and as such does not introduce to the students substantial new material; but rather, provides them with a vehicle for applying and integrating the knowledge and skills they have already acquired in the previous subjects within this degree. In particular, groups of students (or syndicates) will be asked to undertake an integrative exercise that simulates the management of a firm in preparation for their transition back into the workplace.</p>"
