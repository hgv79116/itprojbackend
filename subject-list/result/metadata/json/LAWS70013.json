    "overview": [
        "<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank are arguably two poorly understood international organisations. Both are key components of the international monetary and financial architecture. They also play a vital role in national economies (as seen for example in the IMF's involvement in the Euro-zone crisis or in addressing the economic dislocations caused by global events  and its analytical work on the prevention and resolution of financial and sovereign debt crises) and international development. This subject will focus on the IMF and World Bank while also providing students with a sophisticated understanding of the broader international financial system and its problems. The subject provides a valuable insider's perspective on the 'Bretton Woods' institutions.</p>"
