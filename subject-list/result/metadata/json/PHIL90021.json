    "overview": [
        "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This subject focuses on how we can best develop and harness good ideas. The approach will combine the general and particular. On the general side, we will discuss philosophical questions about conceptual innovation and the nature of truth, and will look at a range of thinking tools, from formal logic to creativity heuristics. On the particular side, we shall study some shining examples of critical and creative thinking in philosophy, science, and the arts. </p>"
