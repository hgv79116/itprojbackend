        "<p>The Developing Clinical Practice 2 subject builds on year 1 and continues to provide the arena in which all the other subjects in the program are integrated into participants' developing expertise as a classroom teacher, and their developing understandings of professional knowledge, professional practice and professional engagement. As clinical practice is the foundation of Faculty of Education's Master of Teaching programs, this subject is underpinned with the core conviction that each and every student can learn, and will learn through teaching interventions that are derived from classroom data and research evidence.</p>",
        "<p>Participants continue to be provided with opportunities to observe demonstrations of quality teaching, by lead / expert teachers from the school or nearby schools. Clinical Specialists and Transition Mentors organise these demonstrations as well as providing regular feedback on teaching practice and professional conduct.</p>",
        "<p>Through direct practical engagement, participants continue to develop and enhance their understanding of the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers (APST) and demonstrate evidence to support the attainment of these standards. This subject also enables participants to prepare for the attainment of full teacher registration by undertaking assessment tasks, including Elements 1-3 of the Assessment for Graduate Teachers (AfGT), that are linked to the Victorian Institute of Teachers (VIT) process for full registration and that comply with registration requirements.</p>"
