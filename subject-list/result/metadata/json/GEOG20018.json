    "overview": [
        "<p>India contains a sixth of the world\u2019s population. It has one of the world\u2019s fastest growing economies and will be increasingly important in the future of Australia. Understanding the complex geographies of contemporary India \u2013 including economic, political, and social change -  is important for young people in Australia, who are likely to have jobs linked to India in the future. Appreciation of Indian dynamics is also important in terms of building the Asia literacy of Australia\u2019s population, enhancing multiculturalism, and countering racism. This subject will enable students to develop a profound understanding of India. Students will learn a range of key skills as part of their analyses of Indian literature, evaluating key ideas such as caste and gender, and appreciating the geographical and social diversity of the Indian subcontinent.</p>",
        "<p>The subject is designed to develop students\u2019 analytical and research skills in relation to (i) India\u2019s changing economy, (ii) the politics of India since 1947, with a particular focus on developments since 2014, (iii) the changing nature of Indian society, including topics such as health, education, gender, environment, and regional difference. Students will engage with relevant disciplinary literature, drawn especially from geography, politics, sociology/anthropology, and Area Studies. They will also engage with films, podcasts, literature, magazines, and online materials so as to appreciate how persuasive arguments can be developed through analysis of multiple sources. A focus on engagement with government, practitioners, NGOs, and citizens in India will also be a feature of the subject.</p>"
