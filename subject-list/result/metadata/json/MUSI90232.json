        "<p>Repetiteurs in this class will advance their skills by focusing on nineteenth, twentieth and twenty-first century repertoire, with particular emphasis given to the concerns of score reduction and conducting ensembles from the keyboard, the class being taught on piano. Students will learn techniques to reduce predominant orchestral scoring styles and be given effective techniques for scanning and sight-reading the full score.</p>",
        "<p>Attention will be paid to score reduction to provide melodic and harmonic clarity and support for the singers. The subject also explores how to conduct from the keyboard, especially in ensembles where the repetiteur is both playing the piano and conducting. To achieve these skills, students will work collaboratively with the lecturer to read through a range of opera scores, and prepare materials for a specific opera or opera scenes.</p>"
