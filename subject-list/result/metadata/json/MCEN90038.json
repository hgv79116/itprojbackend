    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject continues from Engineering Mechanics to deepen the understanding of (momentum-based) Newtonian Mechanics. It focuses on the study of the motion of rigid bodies in 3D space in kinematics, kinetics and finally the Newton Euler approach of obtaining the equation of motion as well as collision of rigid bodies. Extension to multi-body systems is introduced in each concept. System analysis is introduced by focusing on a case study of gyroscopic motion.</p>",
