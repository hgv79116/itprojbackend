    "overview": [
        "<p>Organizations are embedded within a complex network of internal and external stakeholder relationships \u2013 ranging from workers, investors, customers and suppliers to local communities, regulators, unions and other social movements. Because stakeholder interests differ, managers must be capable of reconciling these competing demands and interests to achieve sustainable outcomes. This subject examines how stakeholder management shapes organizational operations and strategic choices, and provides students with practical analytical tools and skills associated with effectively engaging stakeholders in a more sustainable way.  Topics include: understanding the role and power stakeholders, stakeholder analysis and mapping, internal and external stakeholder relationships; stakeholder communication and influence, strategies for stakeholder engagement, dealing with stakeholder conflicts; managing difficult stakeholder relationships; building stakeholder coalitions for shared value.</p>"
