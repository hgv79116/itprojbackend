    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is for students who have an intermediate level of Chinese language skills and minimal literacy skills. It aims to help students make the transition from beginning level textbook Chinese to a more advanced level where they can not only deal with original Chinese materials intended for native-speakers of the Chinese language, but also learn how to effectively analyse various socio-cultural issues related to present-day China.</p>",
        "<p>Students will develop their ability to communicate in Chinese at an advanced level and their analytical skills of the Chinese language by engaging with a range of social-cultural topics associated with contemporary Chinese society and culture. Student expertise in the utilisation of both linguistic and cultural resources will be further developed through reading Chinese texts addressing each of socio-cultural situations, writing and presenting opinion pieces on current socio-cultural or socio-political issues in Chinese, conducting newspaper reading comprehension tasks, and participating in group discussions. The study of Chinese texts will be supported by brief English passages, video, audio and additional reading materials introducing the cultural topics.</p>"
