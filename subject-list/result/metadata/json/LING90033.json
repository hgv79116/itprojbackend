    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces students to the structure and sounds of English. The course provides an introduction to morphology, syntax, semantics and psycholinguistics, with an emphasis on developing skills for analysing language. The course provides an introduction to the International Phonetic Alphabet, illustrates its uses as a transcription tool and provides instruction in both broad and narrow transcription of speech. Students will be introduced to the acoustic analysis of speech sounds, and will gain an understanding of how the acoustic structure of sounds is related to their perception.</p>"
