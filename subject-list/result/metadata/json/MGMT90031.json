        "<p>The use of project management techniques has risen sharply. Examples of projects include research and development studies, reorganisation efforts, implementation of change programs, installation of a new piece of equipment, advertising campaigns, construction, organising special events and other one-off endeavours. The subject will cover the key drivers of project success, training and leadership in project environments. Project selection is the first critical set of decisions. Matching of the projects selected to the organisation\u2019s strategy is taken as the starting point. Practical tools and techniques will then be introduced to manage the project or special event for success. The subject will also involve the use of an appropriate Project Management software package such as MS Project.</p>"
