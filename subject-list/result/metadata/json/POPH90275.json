    "overview": [
        "<p>Mental health is a key public health priority. Mental health conditions have a substantial impact on individuals, families and society worldwide, making them a leading cause of disease burden globally. Many mental health conditions can be prevented and/or treated with effective mental health promotion, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation strategies at the population level.</p>",
        "<p>This subject is an introduction to the field of population mental health and will provide an overview of the trends and determinants of mental health; the inter-connection between mental health and physical health; its association with socio-cultural factors; its differential conceptualisation and manifestations across cultures; the individual, familial, societal and global implications of mental disorders; leading contemporary frameworks, theories and approaches to mental health system development and implementation; and the importance of a holistic and whole-of-society approach. The subject will highlight the critical role of the community and society in supporting people with mental health conditions.  Students will be introduced to some of the major initiatives in this area both within Australia and overseas by experts in these fields.</p>"
