        "<p>An original research project will be conducted and a thesis of 15,000 words completed under academic supervision. Preparation for this subject begins in Year 1 when students undertake PAED 90027 \u2013 Healthcare research: principles and designs. As part of that subject students will be encouraged to work with a research supervisor to develop an original research project and submit any necessary Human Research Ethics applications. Topics may reflect their own interest or relate to current research at the clinical genetics service (Victorian Clinical Genetics Services) or the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute (MCRI) where the Masters is taught.</p>",
        "<p>Data collection commences in Year 2 and students are required to perform relevant data analysis and write a thesis to be submitted at the end of Semester 2.</p>",
        "<p>This is supplemented by fortnightly research tutorials, study in existing short courses and online resources (eg <a href=\"http://courseworks.unimelb.edu.au/\">www.courseworks.unimelb.edu.au</a>) offered through The University of Melbourne that are relevant for individual upskilling.</p>"
