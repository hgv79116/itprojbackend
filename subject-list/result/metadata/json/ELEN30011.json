        "<p><strong>AIM</strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject develops the theoretical and practical tools required to understand, construct, validate and apply models of standard electrical and electronic devices. In particular, students will study the theoretical and practical development of models for devices such as resistors, capacitors, inductors, transformers, motors, batteries, diodes, transistors, and transmission lines. In doing so, students will gain exposure to a variety of fundamental fields in physics, including electromagnetism, semiconductor materials and quantum electronics. This material will be complemented by exposure to experiment design and measurement techniques in the laboratory, the application of models from device manufacturers, and the use of electronic circuit simulation software.<strong><br/><br/>INDICATIVE CONTENT<br/></strong></p>",
        "<p>Topics include:</p>",
        "<p>Vector calculus for device modelling, Maxwell\u2019s equations, physics of conductors and insulators, passive device models (including for resistors, capacitors and inductors), lumped and distributed circuit models for wired interconnections (including treatment of signal integrity and termination strategies), semiconductors and quantum electronics, static and dynamic models for p-n junctions diodes and bipolar junction transistors.</p>"
