    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is designed to consolidate and extend the understanding of theoretical aspects of care of the neonate in the neonatal intensive care unit. It builds on the knowledge and skills learnt in Neonatal Intensive Care 1 and expands the students\u2019 knowledge with regard to the range of patients encountered in neonatal practice settings. Students will build on assessment skills and theoretical knowledge to include assessment and management of the neonatal surgical patient and the assessment and management of specific physical illness states. There is a continued emphasis on scientific principles and research evidence underpinning practice and further developing of skills in problem-solving, critical thinking, rational inquiry and self-directed learning to solve patient management problems in specialty practice.</p>"
