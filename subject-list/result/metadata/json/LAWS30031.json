        "<p>Entertainment adds amusement, diversion and enlightenment to the everyday lives of multiple individuals, groups and societies around the world. Law underpins its existence, and seek to balance interests between creators, investors, celebrities, fans, consumers and wider publics. Yet it faces severe disruption from new media technologies, business models and social practices. Can entertainment survive in its current forms? Is law reform urgently needed?</p>",
        "<p>After an introductory review, we will move on to explore these questions in more detail through a series of case studies, focusing especially (but not exclusively) on the position in the US and Australia. In turn, students will develop their own case studies in guided workshops in the teaching week and subsequent research essays submitted for assessment after teaching is over.</p>",
