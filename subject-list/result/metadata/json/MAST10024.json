        "<p>This subject will introduce mathematical and statistical techniques to illustrate the importance of quantitative modelling and data analysis in biomedicine.</p>",
        "<p>Quantitative models will be explored in a variety of biomedical contexts. Emphasis will be placed on understanding how biological principles can give rise to quantitative models. Topics to be explored include processes at the cellular level and the modelling of the spread of infectious diseases among populations. The fundamental concepts of probability and statistics required for experimental design and data analysis in the biomedical sciences will also be covered.  Emphasis will be placed on the presentation and interpretation of the results from statistical analyses of biomedical data. The mathematical and statistical methods covered will be implemented using a standard computing package and illustrated via specific applications from the biomedical sciences.</p>"
