    "overview": [
        "<p>Social Computing is a field of study that investigates computing techniques and systems to support, mediate, and understand aspects of social behaviours. Understanding the principles and foundations of Social Computing is important because of the rapid proliferation of social systems, particularly those aimed at end-users (e.g. social networking websites, crowd sourcing platforms, knowledge sharing platforms, etc.). This subject will introduce you to key concepts and principles of Social Computing, and provide you with training to investigate how these systems influence human behaviours, how to improve current implementations, and how to identify ways to better support social activities and interactions.</p>"
