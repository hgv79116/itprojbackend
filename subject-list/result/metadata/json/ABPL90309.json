    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides an insight into the issues currently facing the construction industry. It aims to develop an understanding and awareness of the complex nature of construction supply chains and how they may be better managed to improve productivity, value, efficiency and client satisfaction within the construction industry. The network of organisations involved, through upstream and downstream linkages, in the different processes and activities that contribute to the production of construction artifacts is explored. The subject provides an introduction to supply chain management and provides the skills and knowledge needed to map construction supply chains, identify critical nodes and suggest possible solutions for improving existing construction practices. Case studies, site visits and industry guests are used to demonstrate current local and international industry practices and provide examples of the application of supply chain management-related initiatives in real-world projects.</p>"
