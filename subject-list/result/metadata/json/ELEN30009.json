    "overview": [
        "<p><strong> AIMS</strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject develops a fundamental understanding of linear time-invariant network models for the analysis and design of electrical and electronic systems. Such models arise in the study of systems ranging from large-scale power grids to tiny radio frequency signal amplifiers. This subject is one of four subjects that define the Electrical Systems Major in the Bachelor of Science and it is a core requirement for the Master of Engineering (Electrical). It provides a foundation for various subsequent subjects, including ELEN30013 Electronic System Implementation, ELEN90066 Embedded System Design, and ELEN30012 Signal and Systems.<strong><br/><br/>INDICATIVE CONTENT<br/></strong></p>",
        "<p>Topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Transient and frequency domain analysis of linear time-invariant (LTI) models \u2013 linearity, time-invariance, impulse response and convolution, oscillations and damping, the Laplace transform and transfer functions, frequency response and bode plots, lumped versus distributed parameter transfer functions, poles, zeros, and resonance, stability of circuits, modelling and simulation with simulation tools;</li><li>Electrical network models \u2013 one-port elements, impedance functions, two-port elements, dependent sources, matrix representations of two-ports, driving point impedances and network functions, ladder and lattice networks, passive versus active networks, multi-stage modelling and design, and multi-port generalisations;</li><li>Analysis and design of networks involving ideal and non-ideal operational amplifiers with emphasis on the design of active filters and broadband circuits with specific frequency characteristics;</li><li>Circuits and networks for managing voltage and power requirements for common electronic circuits.</li></ul>",
        "<p>These topics will be complemented by tutorials and workshops designed to develop skills in design and modelling of electronic circuits through software tools and building, testing, and verification of electronic circuits.</p>",
