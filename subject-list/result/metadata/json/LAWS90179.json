        "<p>To say that a State or region is \u2018under-developed\u2019 is simultaneously to claim to know something about it and to imply something about how to respond. Development is both an object of science and of law. This subject invites students to think about the mutually constitutive relations between these three terms. It asks: how do lawmakers know things about the developing world? And, what role does science play in governing it?</p>",
        "<p>The subject pays particular attention to how these questions play out in periods of\u2018crisis: during disasters like the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami or the earthquake that rocked Haiti in 2010; and, more generally, with respect to climate change.</p>",
        "<p>Methodologically, students will learn to unpack the science/law-policy distinction using Critical Legal Studies, Science and Technology Studies, and related methodologies.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics will include: </p>",
