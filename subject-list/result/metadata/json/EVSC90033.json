        "<p>The air is an undervalued environmental resource - subject at times to catastrophic and chronic pollution events. 'What constitutes good air?' 'What environmental protections are in place?' and 'How do we know the air quality?' are all questions addressed in this subject. Major infrastructure projects require air quality assessments and emergency/health service providers need to assess air quality data to advise the public. Working with industry professionals working in the air quality space and exploring low-cost sensor technology interfaced with python code students will build their own air monitoring sensor and design an experiment to evaluate the air we breathe - synthesizing the findings into an air action plan.</p>"
