    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject considers a range of fundamental skills and issues pertinent to practising psychologists. Topics include counselling and interviewing techniques, history taking and diagnosis, conducting a mental state examination, developing a client formulation, as well as the importance of self-care. The subject will include opportunities for students to practise newly acquired skills through role-plays and simulated client interactions during the teaching sessions which are primarily full-day workshops.</p>",
        "<p>Students will also complete the Ways of Knowing program.  This interprofessional curriculum activity brings together students from a range of disciplines to engage with multiple knowledges and ways of knowing.  This will be achieved through completion of four nested activities where students will have the opportunity to learn from, with and about students from other disciplines exploring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health and wellbeing, cultural safety and collaborative practice.  The learning activities will require students to critically reflect upon their own knowledges of health, biases and assumptions and aims to develop essential behaviours, values and attitudes required for collaborative and cultural safety practice. </p>"
