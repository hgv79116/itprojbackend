    "overview": [
        "<p>Physiology is the study of body systems and how it maintains homeostasis. The body systems are dynamic processes that must constantly adapt to changes both within the body and the outside environment. This subject will explore various adaptive processes in metabolism, circulation, respiration, body temperature, and muscle that is vital to maintenance of health. We will explore how these systems change and adapt at different life stages or events, such as growth, pregnancy, aging, exercise, or diet and nutrition. In addition, this subject will also explore the adaptive changes required to enable humans to survive in extreme environments or perform acts of physical endurance.</p>",
        "<p>Student will engage with a number of areas of study that reflect the dynamic and evolving nature of physiology and research in physiology. Students will be introduced to new and modern research technologies that showcases recent advances in field of Physiology.</p>",
        "<p>In this subject the lectures are supplemented by workshops where students have the opportunity to work collaboratively on a research project that will bring together elements of theoretical and practical Physiology. This project is designed to extend teamwork experiences, the ability to read critically, and to evaluate and communicate scientific information to both an expert audience, and a general audience.</p>"
