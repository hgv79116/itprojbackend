        "<p>This subject involves a learning contract/project plan to be negotiated between the student and the subject coordinator and completion of a substantive piece of work based on the contract/plan. The focus of the work is an innovative project aimed at improving health outcomes. Students will use the project to develop their capacity to apply and develop the evidence for practice and extend knowledge in an area of their choice that supplements their learning but is not taught in other subjects. The proposed work should also align with the student\u2019s course learning objectives and be linked with other subjects for the purpose of sequential development of knowledge.</p>"
