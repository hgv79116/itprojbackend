    "overview": [
        "<p>Veterinary Professional Practice 1 centres on developing the skills and competencies required for veterinary employability. Students will integrate aspects of anatomy, clinical skills and imaging to enable understanding and implementation of the diagnostic process and treatment procedures. Students will also gain and apply an understanding of the essential employability attributes, including developing effective relationships, enhancing procedural and client communication skills, considering financial, ethical and legal aspects of practice, and curating psychological resources including mindfulness and self-compassion. Students will learn about relationship-centred care and will use ethical frameworks to analyse and address professional ethical challenges. Upon completion of this and the subsequent related subject (Veterinary Professional Practice 2), students will be prepared for their transition into work-integrated curricular experiences in the profession (clinical intra- and extra-mural placements).</p>"
