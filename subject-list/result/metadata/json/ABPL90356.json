        "<p>The multi-award winning Bower Studio has been running for several years (see <a href=\"http://www.bowerstudio.com.au\">www.bowerstudio.com.au</a>) and has teams of students travelling to remote and marginalised communities to consult, design and construct community infrastructure projects. To date we have designed and built projects ranging from early learning centres for Indigenous kids in the Pilbara, computer centres in Indigenous 'town camp' communities in Darwin and Alice Springs, through to composting toilets for coastal communities in Papua New Guinea.</p>",
        "<p>The projects and locations change year by year but follow a similar format with students conducting research, attending seminars and designing and building at the University before spending about ten days on-site in the host community completing the key built outcome. Upon returning to University, the students then prepare their final design submission.</p>",

        "<p>The work is hard, really hard, and the accommodation and food is always basic. However, past students speak of the project as being a highlight of their university education and one of the most rewarding experiences in their lives.</p>",
        "<p>NOTE: The studio has a travelling component, for information about the travelling component please check <a href=\"http://edsc.unimelb.edu.au/travelling-studios\">http://edsc.unimelb.edu.au/travelling-studios</a>. You would need to ensure to organise yourself in relation to your other subjects as no Special Consideration / assignment extension will be granted due to travelling in this studio.</p>",

        "<p>This subject has two fieldwork components, one at a University of Melbourne rural campus and another with the host community in Northern Australia. Students will be required to cover travel and accommodation costs, purchase safety equipment (work boots, hard-hats, etc.) and presentation materials estimated at $2300 per person.</p>"
