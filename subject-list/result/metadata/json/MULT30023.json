        "<p>Technology has a crucial impact on our cultures. Since the beginning of time, humankind has dreamt about the moon and visions about space explorations go way back. In the nineteenth century<em>, </em>numerous painters paid homage to the train as the very symbol of modernity. Enthusiastic visions about the benefits of technology, questions about its dangers and the human-machine relationship are the very essence of the science fiction genre.</p>",
        "<p><em>Science and Engineering in Popular Culture</em> examines ties of technology and art in past and present times. We will look at audiovisual media \u2013 cinematic texts, video games, graphic novels, music videos, photographs and paintings \u2013 to explore the impact of screen media on public interest in and understanding of science and engineering concepts.</p>",
        "<p>Among other issues, the subject investigates the curious absence of female scientists and engineers from cinemascape, looks at screen ethics, and studies sources of community learning in the second millennium.</p>",
        "<p>Because this is a breadth subject, the class is composed of students from different schools and faculties. Each seminar is featured around the screening of an audio-visual text. Analysing these texts from interdisciplinary viewpoints makes for the most productive and enriching discussions!</p>",
        "<p>Students are free to choose their projects, and they receive plenty of feedback to help them progress.</p>",
        "<p>Among other activities, the subject hosts guest speakers and includes an excursion to an institution that promotes encounters of arts and technology. </p>",
