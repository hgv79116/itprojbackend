        "<p>In this project-based subject, students will work with businesses to address real managerial problems using frameworks and concepts acquired during the MBA program. Working in teams, students will apply the skills learned in the programs to identify managerial problems in an ambiguous context, plan and perform appropriate analysis, and derive creative insights that lead to potential solutions, and engage with the relevant stakeholders to drive towards a practically optimal solution. The analysis and proposed solutions will be presented to the business client in a format appropriate for the project, which usually takes the form of a report and presentation to the client.</p>"
