        "<p>This subject examines political dynamics and diplomatic challenges framed by religion in the modern Muslim world: from revolution in Iran to regime change in Egypt (ref. the Arab Spring); from regional tensions in Kashmir to human rights in Afghanistan (ref. the War on Terror). How can we understand and appreciate the religious dynamics underpinning these contexts, including sectarianism and Islamism, with particular reference to the experience of external powers seeking to engage key players within and beyond these contexts? Rooted in an overview 20th century diplomatic history, this subject examines the link between international relations and religion, using detailed case studies to balance academic and applied forms of learning. Alongside critical engagement with academic literature, crisis-oriented role-playing and oral briefing assignments will be used to develop relevant skills.</p>"
