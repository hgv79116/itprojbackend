    "overview": [
        "<p>The purpose of this subject is to study topics on entrepreneurship and innovation. The subject focuses on the creation, assessment, and growth development of new and emerging ventures, whilst paying particular attention to how the organizational requirement change during the launch of an innovation. As this process revolves around how the value proposition is being perceived by all relevant stakeholders, this subject will scrutinize how value is created and appropriated. Topics include introduction to creativity, intellectual property, business models, barriers to successful innovation and entrepreneurship. The subject introduces students to the principles behind the successful creation and launch of an innovation and the creation and growth of an entrepreneurial enterprise. In doing so, the students will not only be required to make an inventory of the various components that make a good business model, but also to understand it dynamically as it changes through the interaction with the stakeholders of the new venture.</p>"
