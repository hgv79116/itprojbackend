    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides further opportunities for Teacher Candidates to consolidate their understanding of the nexus between theory and practice of teaching, drawing on a range of theoretical perspectives and contemporary research. Teacher Candidates will consolidate and deepen their understandings of professional knowledge, clinical teaching practice and professional engagement in the secondary school context.</p>",
        "<p>This subject has a particular focus on assessment of individual students. Teacher Candidates will learn how to closely track student learning, to record and analyse assessment data and make clinical judgements for future teaching. Teacher Candidates will also understand a range of strategies for reporting to students, and parents/carers utilising records of student achievement. Teacher Candidates will extend their responsibility for the planning, implementation and assessment of lessons based on national and state curricula during extended periods of supervised teaching. Teacher Candidates will continue differentiate their teaching to include students with diverse needs and backgrounds and will take into account Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives on learning and development.</p>",
        "<p>Experienced Mentor Teachers will continue to support Teacher Candidates in collaboration with university-based academics who are also engaged in the on-campus teaching program. The Clinical Teaching Practice seminars are framed by the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers at the Graduate Level. At seminars, Teacher Candidates will engage in collaborative learning and critical reflection with topics.</p>"
