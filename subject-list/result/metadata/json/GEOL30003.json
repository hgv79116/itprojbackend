    "overview": [
        "<p>Earth\u2019s sediments record over 4 billion years of environmental evolution and host our modern societies\u2019 water resources. This subject gives a broad introduction to the sedimentary record of Earth\u2019s history as well as groundwater systems in sedimentary aquifers. Topics covered include facies analysis and petrology of carbonate, terrigenous and chemical sediments; techniques used in stratigraphic analysis; sedimentary geochemistry and its applications; post-depositional processes, including diagenesis and weathering, that alter rocks after their formation; chemical interactions between minerals and groundwater in weathered rocks and weathering products; application of sedimentary geology to understanding sediment-hosted resources; characterisation of surface and groundwater systems; rock properties affecting groundwater flow; water balance; groundwater resource assessment; and groundwater supported ecosystems.</p>"
