        "<p>The aim of this subject is to provide students with an understanding of the systematic processes involved in food research and product development. This subject represents a capstone experience for the food science major. It will allow students to experience and conduct basic research projects (minimum six weeks equivalent).</p>",
        "<p>It is anticipated that students will implement the knowledge they have gained via foundation and specialised studies through preparation of a research proposal, and executing that proposal in a laboratory or industry environment. The outcome will involve the development of a new food product, or solving a problem facing the food industry through knowledge of market research, product design and evaluation, packaging, safety, quality and regulatory requirements.</p>",
