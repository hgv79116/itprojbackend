    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is designed for students with a sound background in physics, whose interests lie mainly in applications of physics to systems in the physical sciences, technology or engineering. Physics 2: Physical Science and Technology introduces calculus techniques to the study of the range of principles and applications presented.</p>",
        "<p>Topics include: <br/>Fluids: water and air pressure, breathing, hydraulics, flight (pressure in fluids, buoyancy, fluid flow, viscosity, surface tension). <br/>Electricity and magnetism: electrical devices, lightning, household electricity and electrical safety, electric motors, power generation and transmission, Earth\u2019s magnetic field, particle accelerators, communications (electric charge and field, conductors and insulators, electric potential, capacitance, resistance, electric circuits, magnetic field, Faraday\u2019s law of induction, Maxwell\u2019s equations, electromagnetic waves). <br/>Quantum and atomic physics: spectroscopy, lasers (photon, blackbody radiation, matter waves, quantisation in atoms, interaction of light with matter, x-rays). <br/>Nuclear physics and radiation: nuclear energy, radiation safety, formation of atoms in stars, carbon dating (the atomic nucleus, radioactive decay, half-life, ionising radiation, nuclear fission and fusion).</p>"
