        "<p>This subject involves in-depth analysis of experimental design used for the study of human decision-making. The focus is on the experimental research pipeline. This includes the design of experiments involving human participants and related data analysis in the context of theoretical models of choice under uncertainty, inter-temporal choice, and complex choice situations. The subject also includes topics of good scientific practice and meta-research.</p>"
