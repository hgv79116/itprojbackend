    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject offers a broad introduction to contemporary theories and methods used in the production and critique of architecture in the context of current practice. <br/><br/>Architectural concepts such as program, diagram, transparency, tectonics, materiality, and ornament will be explored along with the contemporary manifestations of landscape urbanism, digital technologies, ecological sustainability, and biomimicry in design. The subject provides a perspective within which contemporary architectural polemics and strategies can be understood so that students can approach their own practice with the knowledge of existing contemporary theories of design.<br/><br/></p>",
