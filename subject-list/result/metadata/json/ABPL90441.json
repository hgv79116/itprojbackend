        "<p>This is a studio-based subject. It builds on the knowledge attained by students in their first year and addresses practical problems, which will vary among studios. Fieldwork locations, themes and interdisciplinary elements may change each semester to respond to emerging practical challenges and opportunities. Individual self-guided work will be complemented by a small amount of group work for the development of team work and leadership skills. Studio options for each semester are presented at   <a href=\"https://edsc.unimelb.edu.au/graduate/subject-options/msd-studios\">https://edsc.unimelb.edu.au/graduate/subject-options/msd-studios</a></p>"
