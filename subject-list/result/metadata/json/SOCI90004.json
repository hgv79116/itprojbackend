    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject gives students a comprehensive understanding of how to critically unpack and analyse social issues and social policies. It provides an introduction to contemporary social theories and perspectives such as governmentality theory, critical race theory, feminist approaches, decolonial perspectives, and comparative welfare state theory as these are applied as critical lenses to better understand policymaking. Moving through a series of policy areas, the subject allows students to develop a thorough understanding of how these issues are framed, debated, and resolved in Australia and internationally. The subject also gives students conceptual tools based on current case studies of decision making for NGO sector and governmental organisations. </p>"
