        "<p><span>After completion of this subject, students will have the knowledge to interpret clinical ultrasound of commonly encountered pathology of the abdomen, including the gastrointestinal system (excluding the renal system), and will be able to write a focused ultrasound report.  Students will have interpreted and written a report on 10 focused abdominal ultrasound studies of a wide range of commonly encountered pathology. Students will obtain knowledge of how to perform relevant ultrasound-guided procedures of the abdomen.</span></p>"
