    "overview": [
        "<p>To provide valuable advice to clients in the construction industry, lawyers need an integrated understanding of the legal and technical aspects of this specialised area of practice. This subject is designed to build such an understanding and to expose students to a wide range of construction law-related topics in an interdisciplinary mode. Students will learn about the key legal principles that are specific to construction law (from project inception through to dispute avoidance and resolution) and their interaction with the technical underpinnings of construction practice. In addition to classroom discussion, students have the opportunity to see principles put into practice through construction site visits and detailed case studies.</p>",
        "<p>The subject lecturers bring to the classroom a combined, multi-disciplinary experience of decades in advising clients in the construction industry</p>",
        "<p>A range of topics is covered in an interdisciplinary mode, integrating a detailed case study and site visit. Such topics may include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Setting up the project: delivery methods, standard forms, subcontracting, costing, risk mitigation (including insurance and performance security)</li><li>Key technical principles: construction technology, engineering services and structures, geotechnical engineering (including the legal treatment of latent conditions), sustainability and building information modelling</li><li>During the project: contract administration, time and programming, payment, variations, major plant deployment, cost control, dispute avoidance and resolution.</li></ul>",
