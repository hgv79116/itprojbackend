        "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This subject is a continuation of the subject \"Dental Research Project 1\" which gave students a background in research design, ethics and statistics. Students were assigned to their groups and allocated projects and should have met and be having regular contact with their supervisor(s). A comprehensive review of the literature together with ethics submissions, where appropriate, should have been completed at the end of Block 4 in first year. In this subject, a continuation of the allocated project will take place. The School reserves the right to adjust the membership of a group when necessary.</p>",
