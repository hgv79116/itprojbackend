    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces students to the utopian, dystopian, and ambivalent implications of technoscience in contemporary life. Grounded in the interdisciplinary field of science and technology studies, students will study how bodies, subjectivity, life, households, work, and the environment are being transformed by technoscience. It will investigate how technoscience blurs the boundaries between humans and machines to equip students with the knowledge and skills to critically analyse historical, social, ethical, economic, and philosophical implications of past, present, and emerging technologies. Topics may include cyborgs, biotechnologies, pharmaceuticals, cyberspace, surveillance, artificial intelligence and automation, and technosolutionism.</p>"
