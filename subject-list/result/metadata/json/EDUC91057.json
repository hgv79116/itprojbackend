        "<p>This subject will support Teacher Candidates\u2019 understanding of the value of multimodal literacies including linguistic, spatial/visual, kinesthetic, oral, and aural, and environmental/Place.  Specific emphasis will be given to how multimodal practices of teaching and learning can be implemented to decolonise the early childhood curriculum, enabling the inclusion of multiple and diverse ways of making meaning as daily teaching practices. The following frameworks will be addressed in the subject include the Early Years and Learning Framework, Victorian Early Learning and Development Framework, and The Australian Curriculum.</p>"
