        "<p>The purpose of this final subject at Melbourne Business School is to help you reflect upon your learning and MBA experience and as you leave, to prepare you for what lies ahead. The capstone subject will revisit and extend learnings from the first part of your MBA, and will help you consolidate some of the lessons from your journey. In this subject, we will focus on the broader context in which your career will develop and will focus on three important concepts: aspirations, commitments, and transitions. The course will serve as an opportunity to engage in extensive personal reflection and will provide you with tools to help navigate your career as it unfolds over the coming years.</p>"
