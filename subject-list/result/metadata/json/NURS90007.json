        "<p>This subject extends nursing knowledge to develop skills beyond those necessary for functioning as a beginning level practitioner in Acute and Critical Care specialty practice settings. Foundational concepts are applied to generate understanding of the pathophysiological, epidemiological, and psycho-social nature of illnesses encountered in specific Critical Care practice settings. A wide range of abnormalities and manifestations associated with disease processes are explored. Learners are encouraged to apply this knowledge to understand medical and nursing interventions and technologies encountered in Acute and Critical Care so that they can implement nursing care in specific practice settings as a proficient level specialty practitioner.</p>"
