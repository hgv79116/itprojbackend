        "<p>Singing, songs and songwriting have long been an agent of social change. In this hands-on practical subject, students will compose and record their own music and to cover other songs, while also surveying songs across different eras and cultures that promote social change. Benefit concerts and music festivals that seek to raise awareness of prominent issues will be explored. Notable songs and spoken word (including Hip Hop) which have impacted social change will be analysed (e.g., Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander songs, peace songs, songs about the environment and sustainability, women\u2019s rights, civil rights, and youth identity issues). Throughout the semester, students will have an opportunity to experiment with different songwriting topics and settings. Students will engage in small-group informal singing and songwriting activities culminating in studio performances and recordings. They will visit a real-world or \u2018virtual\u2019 live music venue and complete a site visit report. Students will have access and support to use musical instruments (such as guitars and ukuleles) and a range of digital music technologies. No prior musical experience is required.</p>"
