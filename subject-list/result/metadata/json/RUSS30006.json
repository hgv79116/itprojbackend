    "overview": [
        "<p>This capstone subject is designed to provide students with a thorough exposure to the language, society and culture of contemporary Russia. </p>",
        "<p>In the first part of the semester, together with further advanced study of the language and some assessment, students will study and discuss key societal and cultural elements of contemporary Russia. This material will also build on the study of 19th-century cultural history already completed in Russian 5.</p>",
        "<p>In the second part of the semester, on-course assessment will cease, and students will engage in independent project work on a topic of their choice (with the approval of the coordinator). The projects will be put online on the LMS with and be open to discussion from other members of the cohort. The projects will require students to draw on their accumulated knowledge of Russian language and Russian cultural history, and engage in extended research in an area of interest to them (e.g. literature, film, media, philosophy, sport, religion). Instead of an exam, students will submit a written version of their research with a personal reflection, as well as present it to their cohort in a celebratory seminar marking the completion of their undergraduate studies in Russian as a Major.</p>",
        "<p>A checklist of skills learnt in their degree will be put on the LMS, aiding students to articulate the skills they have learnt when applying for jobs and future studies.</p>"
