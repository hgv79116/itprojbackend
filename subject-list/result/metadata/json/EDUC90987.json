    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject requires Teacher Candidates to demonstrate their developing professional knowledge, clinical practice, and professional engagement in the primary school context. The school placement focuses on clinical teaching and on developing an understanding of student characteristics, principles of learning and teaching, classroom management and school organisation in a generalist classroom. Candidates take responsibility for the planning, implementation and assessment of lessons based on national and state curricula during extended periods of supervised teaching and across all curriculum areas. Teacher Candidates will differentiate their teaching to include students with diverse needs and backgrounds and will take into account Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives on learning and development.</p>",
        "<p>Experienced Mentor Teachers will support Teacher Candidates in collaboration academics who are also engaged in the on-campus teaching program.</p>",
        "<p>The Clinical Teaching Practice seminars are framed by the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers at the Graduate Level. At seminars, Teacher Candidates will engage in collaborative learning and critical reflection.</p>"
