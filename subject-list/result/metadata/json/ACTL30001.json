        "<p>This subject aims to provide students with a grounding in mathematical and statistical modelling techniques that are of particular relevance to actuarial work, covering survival models concepts, estimation procedures for lifetime distributions, multiple state models, binomial and Poisson models of mortality, actuarial applications of discrete-time and continuous-time  Markov chains. This subject focuses on modelling techniques in life insurance.</p>"
