    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject explores pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response from a multidisciplinary perspective. Focusing on varied pandemic examples, including but not limited to: SARS, MERS, Zika, Rabies, Swine and Avian Influenza, Ebola, HIV/AIDS and COVID-19, the subject provides students with a multi-sectoral framework through which to appraise a range of prevention, preparedness, and response efforts across diverse country contexts. Students will learn how to conceptualise effective pandemic preventions, preparedness, and response as stemming from the intersection of global systems including human and animal health, political, economic, cultural, and environmental systems. A wide range of pandemic and country case studies are presented, with particular attention to equity and inclusion in terms of the diverse and specific needs of, and impacts on, varied populations. The subject emphasises lessons learnt that can be translated into future and ongoing pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response efforts, as well as highlighting key unresolved issues which need attention.</p>",
        "<p>This dual delivery subject will be delivered by a multidisciplinary team of experts from Australia and around the world. Topics covered include multi-sectoral preparedness efforts; One Health, climate change and pandemics; outbreak risk assessment and surveillance; health system resilience and surge capacity; maintaining essential health services; communication for outbreaks and pandemics; community engagement; non-pharmaceutical interventions; dimensions of equity and vulnerability in pandemics; technological advancements and emerging paradigms post COVID; and the politics and economics of pandemics.</p>"
