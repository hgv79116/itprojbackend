        "<p>Bachelor of Commerce students will be assigned in small groups to a host organisation in a country outside Australia. Collaborating in teams, they will undertake a consulting project related to an issue that is of current, practical importance to the host organisation. During the project, student teams will undertake in-depth, self-directed project work in coordination with the host organisation, including  identifying project scope, opportunities, constraints and recommendations. Students will be supported by instructor-led workshops and consultations that provide guidance regarding approaches, tools and techniques, and values and principles for consulting work.</p>",
        "<p>Students will learn to operate in an international context with unstructured and incomplete information in real business settings, to work with primary and secondary data sources and with stakeholders, to develop solutions that consider economic, social and environmental impacts, to work successfully in teams, to present their findings and seek and received constructive feedback in a range of settings. Students will also be encouraged to plan, reflect upon and modify their approaches over the course of the project to improve the outcomes of their efforts.</p>"
