    "overview": [
        "<p>The Ancient Greeks have occupied a central role in modern imaginations of the history of the western world. Building, art and political government were modelled after ancient Greek examples and the ancient Greeks played a pivotal role in the identity of the western world, at least up until World War II.</p>",
        "<p>This subject aims at familiarising students with the most important archaeological sites, artefacts and artistic expressions from the ancient Greek world between the Bronze Age and Late Classical periods. Students will gain skills in analysing artefacts and built environments and learn to connect these to critical historical narratives of ancient Greece. In addition to temples, theatres, sculpture and pottery, students will be introduced to the cultural life of the ancient Greeks including literature and philosophy, the symposium, the role of women and slaves as well as daily life. Students will handle genuine archaeological artefacts, engaging in a detailed analysis of material culture housed in the University's collection.</p>"
