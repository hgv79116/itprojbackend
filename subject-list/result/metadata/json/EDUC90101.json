    "overview": [
        "<p>The subject examines the international debate on the nature and role of English in the world over the past 25 years. Issues of naming and variety are considered and the politics and economics of the spread of English is examined, as well as charges of linguistic imperialism, hegemony, and its impact on languages education more broadly including the teaching of other languages. Students need to demonstrate understanding of the issues presented and be able to assess a given context of English teaching with respect to the issues and propose ethical, linguistically and interculturally sound procedures for policy development and teaching practices.</p>"
