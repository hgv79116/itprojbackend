    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject considers whether and to what extent international human rights law applies to the actions of states outside their sovereign territories. The focus is on international law only, not domestic law.</p>",
        "<p>The extra-territorial application of international human rights law is one of the most contested and fast-moving areas of human rights law today. It is concerned with important and high-profile activities performed by states outside their borders, from war to occupation and anti-piracy and migration-related activities. This relatively under-explored area of law is of considerable current interest to governments (including their armed forces), international organisations and human rights non-government organisations (NGOs).</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>The nature and scope of extra-territorial State activity, from war to occupation, the interception and detention of migrants and \u2018pirates\u2019, and the operation of embassies, military bases and detention facilities</li><li>The main contours of international human rights law</li><li>Relevant principles of general international law, including treaty interpretation, and relevant features of human rights law, including applicability in times of war and occupation, and co-application with other areas of law</li><li>Arguments of principle in favour of and against applicability, including concerns about \u2018legal black holes\u2019, indirect nationality discrimination, abuses of detainees, double standards and \u2018human rights imperialism\u2019</li><li>The main treaty provisions on applicability, including \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 and colonial extension clauses</li><li>Key general features of extra-territorial applicability, including the substantive meaning of human rights law extra-territorially, and the relevance to this of self-determination; the possibility of activating \u2018derogation\u2019 clauses; and whether human rights treaties can and should apply to the actions of contracting states in the territories of other states not also parties to the same treaties</li><li>The meaning of the two \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 triggers for extra-territorial applicability, based on the exercise of control over territory or individuals</li><li>The extra-territorial application of other human rights treaties that use different triggers, notably the anti-discrimination treaties and the 1951 Refugee Convention</li><li>The application and significance of the non-refoulement obligation extra-territorially.</li></ul>"
