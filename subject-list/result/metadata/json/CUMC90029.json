    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject critically evaluates current theories, international standards and processes for sustaining heritage collections, managing change and creating sustainable environments. It engages with sustainable thinking within situated decision-making contexts and values, technical processes, risk management strategies, the ten agents of deterioration, the environment, and stakeholder structures. It examines continuity and change, and considers how these can be effectively communicated and mitigated in centralised and de-centralised collection contexts.</p>",
        "<p>As such, this subject lays a critical foundation for effective professional practice as a preventive conservation conservator and steward for sustainable collection care. Off campus site visits are a regular activity for this subject, which may include visits to collection and conservation facilities, museums, galleries, library, archives and art centres.</p>"
