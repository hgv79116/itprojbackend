    "overview": [
        "<p>The rise of multinational enterprises and cross-border transactions represent an exciting challenge to traditional management theories, as these phenomena raise questions about the universality of concepts typically formulated to explain domestic (or Western) behaviour. International business scholars seek to explore, examine and explain the key defining elements of international business \u2013 location, development and transfer of competitive advantages, managing at a distance, governance decisions, and cross-cultural issues. This subject covers advanced themes and issues in the theory and practice of international business. Drawing on rich and varied theoretical traditions, contemporary quantitative and qualitative research, students will progress through a variety of process, content and contextual considerations to build an advanced perspective on the international business discipline.</p>"
