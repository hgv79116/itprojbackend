        "<p>Students will undertake as individuals or as a member of a team a designated investigative project which could involve a critical literature review, experimental research and/or development, theoretical modelling, process simulation and/or the solution of an industrial problem. Rigorous planning and scheduling of the project, time management, written and verbal technical communication, interpretation of results and team work will be required. Lectures will be presented on laboratory safety, and the use of statistical methods for experimental data analysis.<br/><br/>Engineering graduates need the ability to research topics and to perform structured investigations. This research project subject provides students with an opportunity to develop these skills and to develop an appreciation of the importance of lifelong learning.</p>",

        "<p><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT</strong></p>",
        "<p>The exact content covered in the subject will depend to some extent on the nature of the research project. Topics covered will most probably include literature searches, laboratory safety, risk assessment, data modelling, data analysis, error analysis and report writing.</p>",
        "<p>This subject has been integrated with the Skills Towards Employment Program (STEP) and contains activities that can assist in the completion of the Engineering Practice Hurdle (EPH).<br/><br/></p>"
