    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject examines the transformations of urban life and social belonging by focusing on the related impact of human mobility and new media and communication technologies. It will critically engage with the dominant sociological models for explaining global movement and the emergence of global, mobile media, and will test their relationship to theories of the nation state, diasporic cultures and new urban formations. In particular it will examine the formation of new hybrid identities, cosmopolitan organizations, transnational modes of agency and social interaction. This subject will address the complex cultural transformation of public space and the public sphere in contemporary society. It will situate this discussion in relation to underlying fears towards outsiders and ambivalence towards the impact of new technologies and mobility in general. On completion of this subject, students will be familiar with alternative perspectives for understanding the relation between global flows and local affiliations, and for understanding the emergence of new social spaces and practices in the diasporic cultures of contemporary cities.</p>"
