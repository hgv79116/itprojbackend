        "<p>This course is designed to make students aware of and deal with aspects of society and culture in the Roman empire. Generally the time period covered will be from ca. 100 BC to ca. AD 300, but some topics will necessarily go beyond this period because of the nature of the surviving testimony. Particular emphasis will be placed on ancient evidence, including inscriptions and archaeological and visual material.</p>",
        "<p>Students who undertake this course are expected to have some prior knowledge of Roman history. Prof. Parkin will talk more about this in the first week, and provide some guidance to students on how to refresh their knowledge if they need to.</p>"
