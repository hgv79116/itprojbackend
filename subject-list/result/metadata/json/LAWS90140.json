    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces students to the theory and practice of civil dispute resolution and professional legal ethics. Students will develop a critical understanding of the operation of three key dispute resolution processes, namely, negotiation, mediation and litigation. Students will gain an appreciation of the role of lawyers in the resolution of legal disputes, in terms of the professional skills, ethical responsibilities and legal obligations involved, including an understanding of duties to the client and to the administration of justice. Through their experiences in a simulated civil dispute, and engagement with relevant doctrinal, socio-legal and jurisprudential literature, students will be required to reflect deeply on the processes and outcomes of civil disputes.</p>"
