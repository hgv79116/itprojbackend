    "overview": [
        "<p><em>Unliveable Berlin is a University of Melbourne design studio, organised and run by Michael Roper (Director, Architecture Architecture). This studio will take a group of masters students from architecture, landscape and urban design to the ANCB Metropolitan Laboratory in Berlin where they will explore and develop ideas for experimental housing projects.</em></p>",
        "<p><strong>STUDIO THEME: A CITY IN TRANSITION</strong></p>",
        "<p>Berlin has undergone several periods of trauma and transformation. Growing out of two world wars, living through three decades of east-west division followed by re-unification, rebuilding and more recent bankruptcy, Berlin is riddled with the scars of its history. Politically caught between socialism and capitalism; physically, between the destruction of war and urban regrowth; culturally, between division and unity; this is a city coming to terms with its physical and cultural territories, revelling in the uncertainty of its future.</p>",
        "<p><strong>STUDIO THEME: DESIGNING FOR INCLUSION</strong></p>",
        "<p>Berlin has a history of social exclusion and ideological seclusion. In this context we ask, how does a city express its hostilities and how, as architects, can we foster cities of inclusion? With Berlin as our lab rat, we will consider what it means to accommodate the excluded, and to redress cultural hostilities through architecture and urban thinking.</p>",
        "<p><strong>STUDIO THEME: A VISION FOR HOUSING</strong></p>",
        "<p>Berlin is the heartland of Baugruppen, a model for housing that empowers ordinary citizens to design and finance their own apartment buildings. In Melbourne, the Nightingale movement is a revolution in housing inspired by Baugruppen. Students will have the opportunity to study and visit the Baugruppen projects, along with Berlin\u2019s other experimental housing movements from the 1950s (Hansaviertel) and 1980s (IBA). </p>",
        "<p><strong>STUDIO OUTCOMES: GLOBAL THINKERS</strong></p>",
        "<p>Stripped of well-worn reference points, the travelling studio encourages students to see with fresh eyes. They come to sense a city\u2019s unconscious \u2013 its undercurrents \u2013 developing instincts for the manifold cultural forces that drive a place. Through the travelling studio, we aim to foster broad, global-thinking problem solvers, versed in the physical mechanisms (infrastructural, geographical) and cultural forces (political and social) that underpin urban life.</p>",
        "<p><strong>ANCB: A METROPOLITAN LABORATORY</strong></p>",
        "<p>ANCB is the headquarters for an extensive international network of institutions and universities, supporting research and knowledge transfer in an environment where architects, planners, economists, philosophers, scientists, artists, engineers and ecologists come together to tackle the issues facing globalised urban environments. At ANCB, students will engage with a range of academics, researchers and specialists relevant to the themes of the studio.</p>",
        "<p><strong>COSTS</strong></p>",
        "<p>Students will be expected to cover the costs of their flights, accommodation and living expenses as well as any additional activities undertaken in Berlin. Students may wish to apply for Global Mobility Fund sponsorship. Approximate costs are as follows:</p>",
        "<p>Flights: $3,000</p>",
        "<p>Accommodation: $1,000 - shared accommodation</p>",
        "<p>Living expenses (meals and incidentals): $1,500</p>",
        "<p><strong>CREDIT</strong></p>",

        "<p>Master of Landscape Architecture students can use this subject to count towards the Landscape Architecture elective or Multidisciplinary elective component of their course.</p>",
