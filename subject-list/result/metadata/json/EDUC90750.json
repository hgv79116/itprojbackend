    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is designed to support educators to develop an understanding of trauma-informed perspectives to guide their work in educational settings. Students will explore key educational frameworks that enable them to be trauma aware, including; Brunzell &amp; Stokes (2019), Schimke et al. (2022) and Overstreet &amp; Chafouleas (2016). The trauma informed positive education approach will be used to encourage students to engage in reflection of self and others, to study strength-based approaches to creating change in schools and to explore the social factors that influence education.  This subject aligns with the Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership National Professional Standard for Principals and considers theory that guides self-reflection, self-improvement and self-development.</p>"
