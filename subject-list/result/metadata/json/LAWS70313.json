    "overview": [
        "<p><strong>This subject will be delivered online in 2020 over the scheduled dates.</strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject deals with the body of law and practice that applies to states as they emerge from conflict and try to build strong, prosperous and responsive communities. It lies at the intersection of several bodies of law including international law, international humanitarian law, international human rights law and domestic constitutional law. Many of the issues with which it deals are at the cutting-edge of these fields: the extra-territorial effect of constitutional law; the possibility of a \u2018lex pacificatoria\u2019 to govern the ambiguous character of intra-state peace agreements; the legitimacy of constitutions developed with international assistance; the notion of transformative military occupation. The two teachers in this highly innovative subject bring different bodies of expertise to bear on it. Professor Bruce Oswald is an international and international humanitarian law specialist; Laureate Professor Cheryl Saunders works in the area of comparative constitutional law. Both have practical experience of aspects of post-conflict state-building, which informs their approach to teaching and research in the field.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>The concepts inherent in post-conflict state-building</li><li>International humanitarian law and the law of occupation</li><li>Current trends in peace-building</li><li>The relevance of constitution building to post-conflict state-building</li><li>Role and use of human rights to protect vulnerable groups</li><li>The relevance of context in post-conflict state-building programs</li><li>Role and contribution of civil society.</li></ul>"
