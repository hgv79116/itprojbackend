    "overview": [
        "<p>Industries widely apply systems engineering for various projects (e.g., product design, process improvement) to handle the system complexity and to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency through the project life cycle. This subject offers a practical introduction to the system engineering principles in an industrial context. The lectures and project work will expose students to the various stages of the systems engineering process and a range of simulation techniques.</p>",
        "<p>Topics covered are grouped in four modules: 1) fundamentals of systems engineering; 2) functional analysis and conceptional modelling; 3) model implementation and discrete event simulation; and, 4) model validation and system evaluation. This subject will include a high level of industry engagement. Real world problems and industry projects will be used as learning instrument to provide first hand experience and to reinforce the system thinking as engineers. Industrial speakers are also invited as guest lectures to provide broader examples of engineering projects.</p>",
