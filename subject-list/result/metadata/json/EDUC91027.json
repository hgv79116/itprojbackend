    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject includes Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) and will connect with Place and Country through STEM learning ecologies. The importance of building strong relationships that invite co-participation of children and adults in creating sustainable communities is promoted. Valuing the importance of responsive and reciprocal relationships that engage with local environments and cultural knowledge stories establishes the foundation for children to feel confident exploring and making meaning of their world. STEM promotes new interdisciplinary ways of solving authentic problems using scientific and mathematical ways of thinking. These create learning ecologies where children acquire the foundational skills for exploratory learning.</p>"
