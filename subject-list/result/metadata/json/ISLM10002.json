        "<p>This subject examines the impact of modernity on the Islamic world: how have Muslims rejected, or adapted to, modernity? How have they shaped the terms of modernity itself?

Through a close study of Muslim texts, institutions, and socio-political movements, students will understand how modernity has shaped Muslim discourses as well as the challenges associated with constructing a \u2018Muslim\u2019 identity in today\u2019s modern world</p>"
