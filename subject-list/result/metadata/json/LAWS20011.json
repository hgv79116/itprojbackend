    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides an account of how the law influences sport. Although the subject focuses on legal principles, it will bear in mind sport\u2019s historical, cultural, social and economic context, including the drama and colour of sport\u2019s major events and leading personalities. And although it is inevitably very much concerned with elite professional sports it is not dominated by them, and seeks to cover the widest possible range of sports, professional and amateur.</p>",
        "<p>There will be two main themes to this subject: (1) sports organisation and governance and (2) sports scandals and regulations. The first theme will address the fundamentals of sports law \u2013 the organisation, dispute resolutions, contracts and employment, American model of sports. The second theme will then consider the main issues within sports, such as sports anti-doping, corruption, gambling and match-fixing, and human rights issues.</p>",
        "<p>In sum, the subject is designed to cover fundamental and topical areas of sports law: sports law in general; sports organisation, contract and employment, dispute resolution, sports corruption; sports anti-doping; human rights. Finally, the module is designed around common law jurisdictions but is also informed by a comparative approach reflecting the global administration of sport.</p>"
