        "<p><span>The scale of contemporary travel is staggering. Tourists, businesspeople, refugees, passengers, commuters, students, backpackers, migrants, stowaways, pirates, terrorists\u2014and many more\u2014are on the move. </span><span>Travel has often been seen as devoid of economic, political and socio-cultural significance. But issues of movement\u2014too much or too little; too fast or too slow; or the wrong sort at the wrong time\u2014are central to many present-day controversies. From airport expansion to design responses to climate change; and from the spectre of driverless cars to the plight of homeless people, issues of \u2018mobility\u2019 are centre stage. </span></p>",
        "<p><span> </span></p>",
        "<p><span>To better understand power in our contemporary world, we need to understand the meanings attached to these movements; how these movements feel; how fast things move; the routes these movements take; and how and when things stop. Through this subject we will explore how mobility is a fundamental part of our world. </span><span>This subject is taught intensively over two weeks through lectures, seminars, workshops, and fieldtrips involving fieldwork in different areas of central Melbourne. </span></p>"
