        "<p>This subject comprises five modules:</p>",
        "<p><strong>General Anatomy and Physiology:</strong> this subject component integrates the structure and function of human body systems relevant to the oral health care of the dental patient. Topics to be covered include the structure and function of the cardiovascular, lymphatic, nervous, respiratory and gastrointestinal systems.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Oral Anatomy and Histology</strong>: this subject component covers the hard and soft tissues of the human dentition. Topics to be covered include the morphological anatomy of both the deciduous and permanent dentition as well as the development and microscopic structure of the human oral tissues such as enamel, dentine, dental pulp and the periodontal ligament.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Plaque Related Diseases</strong>: this subject component integrates concepts in microbiology, microbial ecology, biochemistry, immunology and physiology that are relevant to the understanding of oral health and disease. Throughout this subject, students will develop knowledge regarding the common oral diseases that are caused by bacteria that are part of dental plaque, especially periodontitis and dental caries (tooth decay). Students will gain knowledge of the theoretical basis supporting the prevention of these diseases at an individual and community level.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Head and Neck Anatomy:</strong> this subject component integrates the structure and function of body tissues of the head and neck including the embryology of the craniofacial region, the structure and function of the nerve and vascular supply of the head and neck, lymphatic drainage of the head, osteology of the skull, myology of the head and neck and the pterygomandibular space.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Pathology</strong>: this subject component covers inflammation and infections, defense mechanism, immunology, healing and repair; pathological conditions causing abnormal bleeding; neoplasia and cardio-vascular disease; disorders of the nervous system and endocrine system; and infectious diseases and allergies.</p>"
