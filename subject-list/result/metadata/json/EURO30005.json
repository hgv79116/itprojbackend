    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject explores portrayals and perceptions of perceived \u201cOthers\u201d in Europe \u2013 such as Jews, Muslims, \u201cgypsies\u201d and refugees - and how they have contributed to European identities in the past and today. Looking at literature, film, philosophy, music, food and popular culture, the subject will seek to understand how Europe\u2019s Others are essential to the formation and maintenance of national, ethnic and religious identities in many European countries. It will examine the role of Others \u201cwithin\u201d (such as the Jews) and Others \u201cwithout\u201d (such as colonial subjects) and consider kinds of European \u201cOthering\u201d that position the Other as either appealing and attractive or threatening and repulsive. From colonial-era exoticisation to present day xenophobia, European views of the Other have been central to definitions of the self and shaped the continent\u2019s history, politics, culture and languages. Students will gain an appreciation of nation and national identity in Europe as a discursive and comparative process, and an understanding of the distinct national stories of a number of European countries.</p>"
