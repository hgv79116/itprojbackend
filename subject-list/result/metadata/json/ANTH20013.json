        "<p>In contemporary societies, few of our activities are anonymous. From paying with credit cards to browsing the internet, an increasing amount of information is stored and processed in the interest of public safety. But who is monitoring these data, and why? Looking at ethnographic and historical analyses of new and old methods of surveillance, this subject explores the \u201cDeep State\u201d and its transformations over time.</p>",
        "<p>Throughout the semester, we will examine the networks of economic, political, and military interests that covertly enable different forms of state surveillance. Looking ethnographically at how the experiences of diplomats, spies, and soldiers changed over time, we will understand how states adapt to the digital era\u2014and how common citizens navigate a world without privacy. Students will be required to engage with interactive activities in order to finish this assessment.</p>"
