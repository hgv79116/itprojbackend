        "<p>Behavioural and Cognitive Neuroscience brings together the experimental and modelling techniques of cognitive psychology with the measurement and imaging methods of neuroscience to explain how mental processes such as perceptions, memories, and thoughts are implemented in the living, functioning brain.</p>",
        "<p>This subject comprises a series of seminars exploring the mind-brain as a system that can be investigated and explained at different scales and levels of complexity, from single-cell recordings of firing neurons, to the modular systems involved in visual, spatial and auditory cognition, to the networks of neural circuits that link regions of the brain and underpin complex cognitive processes involved in attention, learning, memory, language, decision-making, and consciousness. The seminars may also explore the ways in which neuroscience informs our understanding of how behaviour, cognition and neurobiology are influenced by internal and external factors such as emotions and personality traits, pharmacological substances, sleep states of consciousness, and psychopathology.</p>",
        "<p>Students will gain an appreciation of the integrative nature of cognitive and behavioural neurosciences, and of the range of methods used within the field, including methods for stimulating and recording from living neurons, methods for imaging brain structure and functioning, and techniques for modelling cognitive processes and mapping these to the underlying neural circuitry. Students will learn to evaluate the strengths and limitations of the various methods, and to assess their applicability for addressing particular research questions.</p>"
