    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides an introduction to Roman law (no prior knowledge of Roman history, of Latin, or of law is required) in which legal developments are linked to the social, cultural, and historical realities of the classical period over more than a millennium. The main legal sources will be considered and the legal institutions, particularly the law of persons, will be examined in the context of their historical and social contexts. Students will deal with ancient legal sources in translation (such as Justinian\u2019s <em>Corpus Iuris Civilis</em>), will gain knowledge of legal structures that have influenced modern legal systems, and will study the realities of life for the millions of people who lived under the umbrella of Roman law.</p>"
