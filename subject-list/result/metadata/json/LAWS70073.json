    "overview": [
        "<p>Expert evidence continues to play a major role in civil litigation and criminal prosecution, as well as in administrative regulation. Moreover, the field of expertise in law has become the site of numerous contemporary controversies over judicial standards for admissibility of expertise, how to evaluate the reliability of expert testimony and the ethics of experts and attorneys who present expert testimony. This subject is primarily a detailed examination of the law and policy of the regulation of expert evidence in Australia, as well as comparative reform movements of likely significance to Australia in the future, notably developments in the United States. The materials for the subject, most of which are from court files of actual cases, will emphasise the practical uses of expert evidence inside and outside the courtroom.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>The legal framework for regulating expert evidence</li><li>Debate and controversies about expertise</li><li>The admissibility of expert testimony</li><li>Restrictions on the conduct of experts</li><li>Use of expert evidence inside and outside courtrooms.</li></ul>",
        "<p>The above topics will be illuminated through the study of specific instances of expert evidence, conduct and regulation that have prompted change and reform or controversy in Australia or other countries, especially the United States.</p>"
