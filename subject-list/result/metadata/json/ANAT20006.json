    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides an overview of human anatomy. We expect that a student who completes this subject should be able to comprehend the terminology of human topographic and developmental anatomy; the principles relating to each type of anatomical structure (skin, fascia and skeletal muscle, bones and joints, vessels and nerves, visceral structures); the essential factual information regarding the specific anatomical structures forming the body's major organ systems (musculoskeletal, nervous, cardiorespiratory, digestive, genitourinary); the boundaries and contents of clinically important regions; and the appearance of normal anatomical structures via modern imaging techniques. Lectures on anatomy will be supplemented by online learning material, and practical classes that incorporate use of prosected cadaveric specimens and modern imaging.</p>"
