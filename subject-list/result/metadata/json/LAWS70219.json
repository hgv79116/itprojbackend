        "<p>International environmental law is the field of public international law concerned principally with the protection of the natural environment. It is a vitally important branch of international law, seeking as it does to safeguard the environment on which humanity depends for its very existence. International environmental law seeks to integrate the activities of diverse actors \u2014 states, international organisations, businesses, communities and non-government organisations (NGOs) \u2014 and uses a wide range of legal tools (including economic instruments and participatory mechanisms) to address pressing environmental concerns.

The lecturers in the subject are international environmental law experts, with both academic and practical experience in the field, which will be drawn into the delivery of a stimulating and relevant subject.</p>",
