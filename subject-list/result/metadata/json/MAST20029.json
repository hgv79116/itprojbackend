    "overview": [
        "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This subject introduces important mathematical methods required in engineering such as manipulating vector differential operators, computing multiple integrals and using integral theorems. A range of ordinary and partial differential equations are solved by a variety of methods and their solution behaviour is interpreted. The subject also introduces sequences and series including the concepts of convergence and divergence.</p>",
        "<p class=\"SSPBodyText\"> </p>",
        "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Topics include: Vector calculus, including Gauss\u2019 and Stokes\u2019 Theorems; sequences and series; Fourier series, Laplace transforms; systems of homogeneous ordinary differential equations, including phase plane and linearization for nonlinear systems; second order partial differential equations and separation of variables.</p>",
