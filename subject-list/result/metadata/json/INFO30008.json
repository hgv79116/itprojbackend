        "<p>As the 25pt capstone for the Digital Technologies Major, this subject creates an opportunity for students to work as an independent team to develop and evaluate a novel proposal for a new interactive technology or new application of existing technologies. The group will work under a supervisory framework and be given regular briefings on their activities and expected progress. Using knowledge and techniques from INFO10003 Fundamentals of Interaction Design, the group will identify and analyse an existing situation of use, develop a \u2018design concept\u2019, and a digital prototype to realise part of that concept. Using knowledge and techniques from INFO20004 Usability Evaluation Methods, the group will conduct an evaluation of their prototype and interpret the resulting findings. Students will learn how to develop a technology innovation proposal for their design concept that builds on evaluation findings to mount a business case.</p>"
