        "<p>This research-focussed subject will draw together, and enable students to apply, the knowledge and skills they have acquired in the Master of Supply Chain Management program. They will undertake a practical investigation of a supply chain challenge/issue and develop a plan for how to solve it. Within a specific supply chain domain to be chosen by the student and agreed by the subject coordinator, this subject will require investigation of all major aspects of the supply chain. It will typically involve a feasibility study or business plan for a supply chain improvement, design or change.</p>"
