    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will undertake a critical analysis of the changing structure and behaviour of work and occupations in modern society. It will engage with the theoretical debates and empirical research that focus on the organizational development and work and occupations in society more generally. The class will focus on how work and occupations are structured, evolve over time and replicate and reinforce existing inequalities. The course will provide a range of sociological perspectives on the subject. In addition, guest lectures by industry experts are arranged so that students get acquainted with recent developments, practical issues and challenges in work settings as a consequence of the changing nature of work. Students will be asked to draw upon theory and contemplate potential intervention strategies to mitigate some of these current problems. These strategies will be presented to the industry experts.</p>"
