    "overview": [
        "<p>Initially the subject focuses on how drugs use, cultivation or manufacture and trafficking are regulated in Western countries. The subject will then introduce relevant international regimes and the national regulatory and institutional frameworks for illicit drugs law in each of the countries selected. The second half of the subject will comprise a series of studies of significant and/or high-profile cases from the countries selected, in which the practical application of the regimes examined earlier are investigated. A comparative approach will be applied throughout.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics may include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Drugs use, manufacture/cultivation and trafficking: regulatory choices;</li><li>Delivering social policy through regulation and drugs law, including the interaction between punishment and health-based approaches to illicit drug use;</li><li>The interaction between international human rights and drug control law and norms and domestic law and practice;</li><li>Diverse approaches within Asia to the regulation of drugs, through detailed and nuanced examination of the relevant administrative, criminal and procedure laws, taking into account different legal systems, social, political and cultural traditions, structures and practices;</li><li>The role played by different legal institutions in the regulation of drugs offences regionally, including courts, police, prosecutors, defence lawyers, NGOS etc;</li><li>The contribution made to the regulation of drugs and drugs-related offences by international regulatory frameworks;</li><li>The impacts of non-legal networks and institutions on the development, implementation and review of drugs laws in the region;</li><li>Divergent attitudes and practices to the death penalty;</li><li>Drugs-law-related reforms arising from the comparisons; and</li><li>The possibilities for convergence or harmonisation of drugs law in Asia.</li></ul>"
