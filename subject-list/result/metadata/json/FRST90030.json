    "overview": [
        "<p>The Asia Pacific region is of crucial importance to Australia and to the future management of global forest resources. The region has over half the world\u2019s population and countries with the fastest growing populations and economies. This is placing increased demand on forest resources in the region and elsewhere. There are extensive spiritual and cultural associations between people and forests in this region and an extensive history of forest use and development. In this subject students experience the diversity of connections between forests and people in Laos and Vietnam to illustrate the importance of forests to local and national development, and contemporary forest policy and management challenges in the region. The program includes policy briefings and site visits to conservation and production forests, local village forests, hydropower and plantation development projects and small- and large-scale forest industries.</p>",
