        "<p>The Humanitarian Design Internship is an educational study tour that provides students with insights into sustainable built environment design. The internship will provide students with knowledge and application of Laurie Baker\u2019s approach to building design and construction techniques that are low cost, context and climate responsive, and socially inclusive. Students will develop a deeper understanding and need to move towards a Green Habitat and the role innovative building technologies and design can play in creating positive change within Indian communities. Students will have first-hand experience working in culturally different and resource constrained environments. They will work collaboratively with architects and builders at the Laurie Baker Centre for Habitat Studies to learn low cost, contextually appropriate design and building techniques through hands-on workshops and site visits. Participants will undertake more than 80 hours of full-time design work experience over 10 days in India. Students will undertake a team design project in conjunction with Indian partners.</p>",
