        "<p>This subject is designed to build on the knowledge and skills learnt in Foundations in Cancer &amp; Pall. Care 1 to consolidate and extend the integration of theoretical and practical aspects of specialty nursing for the beginning specialty Cancer &amp; Palliative Care nurse.</p>",
        "<p>It expands the student's knowledge with regard to the range of patient's encountered in cancer and palliative care practice settings, the complexity of disease processes, treatments (including pharmacology), symptoms and symptom management, and subsequent nursing assessments, interventions and supporting technical skills. Students also learn how to anticipate, identify and manage oncology and palliative care emergencies.</p>",
        "<p>There is a continued emphasis on scientific principles and research evidence underpinning practice and further developing beginning skills in problem-solving, critical thinking, rational inquiry and self-directed learning to solve patient management problems in specialty practice.</p>",
        "<p>Students engage in field practice to address learning objectives focusing on relating the underlying physiological and pathophysiological processes to assessment data; differentiating the intended and unintended outcomes of therapeutic interventions in specialty practice; applying theoretical knowledge to technical skill development and evaluating the practice of caring for patients in the Cancer and Palliative Care practice settings.</p>"
