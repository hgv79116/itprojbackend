    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is designed for students interested in becoming <strong>career researchers</strong>. Students will work in groups of 10-12 individuals. Each group will select one project from a list of available research questions, research appropriate background information, formulate hypotheses/aims, design an experiment to test those hypotheses/aims, carry out the experiment over a 4 week experimental period, and ultimately write up their findings in the format of a peer-reviewed journal article. This subject will allow more independence in conceptualisation and execution of the research questions than the second-year subject <em>Research-Based Physiology (PHYS20009).</em></p>"
