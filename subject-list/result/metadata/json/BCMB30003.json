    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject describes the molecular mechanisms underpinning eukaryotic cell organisation, morphology and behaviour and their importance in biomedicine. We will explore the relationships between cellular organisation and the biological functions of normal and stressed cells, as well experimental strategies for investigating the molecular basis of these relationships. The subject matter includes the compartmentalisation of eukaryotic cells; intracellular trafficking of biomolecules; the structure, function and biogenesis of subcellular organelles; protein folding and maturation; vesicle-mediated transport; structure and function of the extracellular matrix and cell adhesion molecules and their role in diseased states such as malignancies; cellular stress responses and linked signal transduction events; cytoskeletal structures and the signal transduction processes regulating the assembly and disassembly of actin-cytoskeleton; molecular processes determining cell movement and shape changes; imaging of processes within live cells.</p>"
