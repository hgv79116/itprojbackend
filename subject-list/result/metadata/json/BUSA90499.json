        "<p>This subject is the introduction to the program of Masters in Business Analytics. The subject will focus on two issues: (I) introduce students to business problems that are best addressed with analytics and the complexities of business problems, and (2) the complexities of possible solutions to those problems. To address the implementation of those solutions, team processes will be examined and project management tools will be provided.</p>",
        "<p>Students will be presented with a data set and a case study of an organization facing a significant business problem. Students will be asked to prepare possible solutions to the problem, which will be revisited in the Business Analytics Applications subject at the end of their program of study. Assessment in this subject will focus on the team processes and project management tools applied to this case study.</p>",
