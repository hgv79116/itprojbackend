    "overview": [
        "<p>The subject analyses the dynamic re-emergence of China as a world economic power since the late 1970s, when China embarked on an extensive program of economic reform. We begin with an exploration of the early modern economic system that the People's Republic of China inherited in 1949. Next we explore the development strategies of the period under Mao Zedong. The primary focus of the subject is on the new economy that emerged under Deng Xiaoping from the 1980s, and the increasing complexity of economic reform as China joined the World Trade Organization in late 2001. We examine in detail such topics as changes in agriculture and rural living standards, the role of foreign direct investment and the multinational enterprise, the reform of state owned enterprises and corporate governance, and the emergence of a vibrant private sector and an increasingly large consumer market. Students will be able to apply the skills acquired to the analysis of not only China, but also other emerging markets or transitional economies in the contemporary global economy.</p>"
