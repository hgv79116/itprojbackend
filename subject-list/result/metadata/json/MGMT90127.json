    "overview": [
        "<p>Leadership is a pivotal part of every formal and informal group, every community and global organisation. Leaders make a difference in everything from local informal networks to giant corporations. Leading involves a critical connection between the individual talent and skill of particular leaders and the formal authority and responsibility vested in the positions they occupy. It is personal and structural; it is something learned and practised every day; it is rooted in deep aspects of personality, gender and culture. </p>",
        "<p>This subject helps students develop leadership skills by examining the attributes of leadership and the roles that leaders play. We do this through a dialogue between contemporary leadership theory and \u2018classic texts\u2019 such as Sophocles, Machiavelli, Shakespeare, Camus and Sun Tzu, examining how these classic texts position the leader in different contexts involving the development of grand visions, building support, dealing with threats, imposing costs, creating alliances and finding a moral compass. We use contemporary leadership theories and cases to interpret and analyse these elements and to see what works and why.</p>",
        "<p>Study, discussion and analysis of leadership theory will be complemented by guest speakers, and opportunities for group discussion and critical self-reflection.</p>",
        "<p>This subject compulsory in the Executive Master of Arts (MC-EMA), and is only open to students admitted into the Executive Master of Arts</p>"
