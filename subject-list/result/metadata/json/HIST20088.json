        "<p>In 1968 Australian Anthropologist WEH Stanner pinpointed a profound silence about the relationship between settler Australians and Aboriginal people. He argued settler Australian people unconsciously refused to discuss with Aboriginal people historical matters of their history, their possession and dispossession of Country. The legacies of this silence and dispossession have been profound. Since Stanner\u2019s famous call to awaken Aboriginal history in Australia, much work has been done to create new foundations of Aboriginal history which continue to emerge. These histories often cross disciplinary boundaries of the academy including history, anthropology, geography, philosophy, science and more. As historian Bain Attwood has commented, in Australia the telling of Aboriginal history clashes with political agendas and with people. The legitimacy of Australia\u2019s nationhood is often embroiled in Indigenous historiographical debate, and depending on whose experience of history is heard, different stories emerge.</p>",
        "<p>During weekly lectures students will discover Charles Perkins' oral history narrative recorded by historian Dr Peter Read AM for the writing of his book entitled, Charles Perkins: a biography. Students will be introduced to oral history methodology, the ethics, politics and historiography of Indigenous history making in Australia across deep time and in emerging spaces as they complete further readings throughout this subject, in conversation with Perkins\u2019 biography. Key moments of Perkins' life will be explored such as his legacy of the Freedom Ride and associated narratives including for example, segregation, assimilation and discrimination, land rights, Aboriginal identity and belonging, Indigenous political voice, self-determination and more.</p>",
        "<p>During tutorial sessions students will be asked to think critically and to engage in discussion of Indigenous historical narratives using multiple source material and oral history archival material.</p>"
