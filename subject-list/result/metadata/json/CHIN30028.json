        "<p>This is a subject for Chinese background speakers who either studied in a Chinese\u2010speaking environment but did not complete primary school there, or who studied Chinese as an additional language in Australian schools but have grown up in a family where Mandarin or any Chinese dialects have been used. This subject is also for non\u2010background speakers of Chinese who have developed their skills in Chinese language.</p>",
        "<p>Students will develop their ability to communicate in Chinese at an advanced level and conduct discussion on a range of topics by engaging with the various social and cultural situations in Chinese society. Student expertise in the employment of both advanced linguistic and cultural resources is developed through reading relatively complex Chinese texts addressing each of these cultural situations, acquiring the literacies associated with these situations. The study of Chinese texts is not only supported by additional materials introducing the cultural topics, but also supplemented by students\u2019 oral presentations and engaging in group discussions.</p>"
