        "<p>Students will travel to a community destination where they will have first-hand experience with local historical and contemporary practices, artists, galleries and museums, alongside Indigenous Knowledge systems.</p>",
        "<p>Students learn Indigenous ways of valuing, ways of being, ways of knowing and ways of doing, bringing Indigenous Knowledges and approaches for a contextual understanding of the production and presentation of art and the protocols and processes that inform Indigenous ways of art creation.</p>",
        "<p>Students will be challenged to think beyond the limitations of their current art practice with emphasis placed on analysing and discussing art and its cultural, historical and institutional contexts. Through a series of field trips and tutorials, students will generate new work to be exhibited upon return to Melbourne.</p>",
