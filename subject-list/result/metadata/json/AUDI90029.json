    "overview": [
        "<p>The Clinical Processes B subject continues from knowledge and skills gained in Clinical Processes A, from Semester 1. Students will develop their understanding of processes of speech pathology practice relevant to client management, including treatment planning and implementation, outcome measurement and handover. This subject will build upon skills of self-review and reflection that were established in Clinical Processes A. Clinical Processes B will provide an introduction to the principles of evidence-based practice, and critical appraisal of the literature. This subject is structured around workshops with group discussions/activities, interactive learning and role play.</p>"
