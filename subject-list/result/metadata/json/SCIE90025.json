        "<p>In this subject, students will apply the skills developed during the practical training subjects to solve an industry-relevant problem, either in industry or research. Working in teams or individually under only general guidance from staff members, they will be required to design, implement, analyse and report on the project. Emphasis will be on providing advice to the client.</p>",
        "<p>Application of the technical and analytical skills that they have learned during their degree will challenge them to develop proficiencies in both analysis and reporting that approach the quality of similar work expected in the workforce. An important focus will be the development of the ability to present results in ways that can be best adopted by industry-based clients.</p>"
