    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides an overview of data science concepts and techniques as they pertain to the field of biology. Students will learn how to apply data science methods to real-world biological data, including techniques for data collection, curation, analysis, and visualization. The subject will provide practical skills in programming languages commonly used for data science, such as R or Python, and best practices for reproducible research, including documentation and data sharing. It will also provide with the students a practical experience of high-performance computing (HPC) and cloud computing. By the end of the subject, students will have developed a robust foundation across this set of skills, empowering them to work confidently with the kind of large-scale dataset that is becoming increasingly common across all fields of biology.\u202f </p>"
