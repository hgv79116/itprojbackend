    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will introduce students to the principal rights and obligations created by the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) and their equivalent in the <em>Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001</em> (ASIC Act). The ACL is a generic law operating Australia wide, developed to protect the interests of consumers. It was introduced in 2010 in the form of Schedule 2 of <em>the Competition and Consumer Law 2010</em> although it has antecedents dating back to the State and Territory sale of goods acts and the Australian <em>Trade Practices Act 1974</em>.</p>",
        "<p>The focus of the subject is on the current law. However, the policy and economic underpinning of the ACL are also considered, as are some of the current debates concerning consumer protection. The subject has a practical orientation, designed to assist students: <em>as consumers</em> - to know, understand and pursue their rights; and <em>as lawyers</em> to equip them to advise consumers and business suppliers of their rights and obligations and assist regulators to effectively carry out their responsibilities.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics are:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Consumer protection in Australia and introduction to the ACL</li><li>Policy objectives of the ACL and the economics of consumer protection</li><li>Misleading or deceptive conduct</li><li>False or misleading representations</li><li>Unconscionable conduct</li><li>Unfair contract terms</li><li>The consumer guarantees regime</li><li>Consumer transactions</li><li>Product safety</li><li>Manufacturers\u2019 liability</li><li>Enforcement and remedies</li></ul>"
