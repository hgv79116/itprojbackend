    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides an introduction to stochastic calculus and mathematics of financial derivatives. Stochastic calculus is essentially a theory of integration of a stochastic process with respect to another stochastic process, created for situations where conventional integration will not be possible. Apart from being an interesting and deep mathematical theory, stochastic calculus has been used with great success in numerous application areas, from engineering and control theory to mathematical biology, theory of cognition and financial mathematics.</p>"
