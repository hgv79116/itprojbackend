        "<p>Students will learn about how educators can use action research methods to improve their teaching practice. Students will develop skills in using clinical models to target teaching to the point of student need and evaluate the effectiveness of their interventions. There will be analysis and discussion of exemplars of clinical praxis, together with an analysis of case studies of student learning. Course participants will also use tools to reflect on examples of teaching and consider means of improving teaching, and will study how to integrate a clinical model into day-to-day teaching practice.</p>"
