    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will focus on the development of visual documentation of cities around the world after the Covid-19 pandemic. Since March 11 when the pandemic officially began, multiple ways have been adopted to address measures of confinement, quarantine or isolation, by different national and local governments around the world. The state of emergency that the pandemic has imposed, has encouraged us to adapt, build and inhabit a new social context, dependent on new technologies.</p>",
        "<p>The question we will be asking is: what comes next? We will be working and collaborating with other schools of architecture spread across four continents: Europe, North America, South America and Asia (Architectural Association, UK; SCI_Arc, USA; University of Los Andes, Colombia and possibly others). The aim of this elective is to build an atlas of the Non-Fictional City, which will result in publication and exhibitions around the world.</p>"
