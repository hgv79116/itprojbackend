    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject builds on basic journalistic interview and research skills to introduce the discipline and advanced research techniques of investigative journalism. It discusses the ethics, obligations, role and challenges of investigative journalism in the western democratic tradition and, as appropriate, in other political contexts. Students will explore and interrogate a range of opportunities to source information: public records, open source intelligence, Freedom of Information legislation, crowd sourcing, data analysis, advanced verification and security and safety technologies. They will be introduced to the multiple ethical and legal issues involved in use of confidential sources and unauthorised disclosures, and how this relates to core journalistic ethical principles. Students will be strongly encouraged to initiate and undertake an investigation as part of the subject, with an option to pursue an analytical essay as an alternative.</p>",
