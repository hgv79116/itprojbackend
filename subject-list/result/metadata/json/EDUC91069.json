    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject uses the clinical teaching model to build on understandings developed through the subject Language and Literacy (Birth to 8 Years).  This subject references the Australian/Victorian Early Years Learning and Development Frameworks and Curricula. Emphasis will be on theoretical perspectives of literacy acquisition and approaches that support the interrelationship between oral language, reading and writing. </p>",
        "<p>This subject, underpinned by the understanding of literacy as a social practice, introduces Teacher Candidates to theory, research and practice that informs the development of literacy in the early years of schooling (Foundation to Year 2). Focused attention will be given to aspects of the English language such as phonological development, including phonemic awareness, language and reading comprehension, vocabulary, reading fluency, grammar and oral language. Theories of reading acquisition and theories of early writing development, alongside curriculum frameworks and assessment tools will be related to pedagogical practices for diverse learners. Alongside print-based texts, multimedia texts which support literacy development and engagement will also be implemented.</p>"
