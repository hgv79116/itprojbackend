    "overview": [
        "<p>Statics introduces the principles of how objects behave when subject to forces with a mix of design projects, interactive workshops and lectures. It assumes a preference of mathematical, graphical and analytical ways of knowing, quantitative analysis and physical principles. Through analysis, model simulations, laboratory work, testing and evaluation, students will explore the fundamentals of structural analysis and commonly used materials, construction/manufacturing methods and systems. Considering the design, fabrication, buildability and sustainability issues will provide the contextual links between statics theory and the finished product.</p>",
        "<p>This subject will provide a lens on the University\u2019s Joining Melbourne Modules. These will be completed in parallel to the subject - unless already successfully completed. It will also support the Discovery goals for commencing students by introducing emerging concepts and research in the discipline area; ways to connect with the larger University community including peers, teachers and student groups; and awareness of the academic expectations, and of wellbeing support offered at the University of Melbourne.</p>"
