    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides an advanced introduction to the history, theory, institutions and practice of international governance and law. The subject will provide students with a broad understanding of the evolution of the international system of states, the development of diplomacy, the evolution of international law (including the role of both soft &amp; hard law), the changing form and practice of multilateralism and the emergence of non-state or hybrid forms of power and authority. Key challenges in global governance will be critically explored, including the impact of globalisation on the political autonomy of states; the future of multilateralism; the accountability, representativeness and legitimacy of international organisations and international regimes and the challenge of democratising global governance; the role of non-state actors and civil society; and the challenge of coordinating and harmonising an increasingly dense network of international organisations and regimes.</p>"
