    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject explores the theory and history of cultural heritage with a focus on architectural and urban conservation. Ideas and practices of heritage are examined through approaches taken to the conservation of buildings, precincts, neighbourhoods, towns, and landscapes. A range of approaches for designing, planning, managing, and researching heritage places are considered. Key topics include the emergence of modern conservation; statutory heritage regimes and designations; the role of charters and doctrines such as the Burra Charter and values-based conservation; and the evolving politics of heritage. This subject also highlights areas of scholarship and practice which challenge traditional approaches such as Aboriginal heritage; community participation; intangible heritage; climate change; and urban development. The subject is taught by academics and leading heritage practitioners and delivered as a mixture of seminars and field trips.</p>"
