    "overview": [
        "<p>To become effective research scientists, students need to develop skills such as critical review and analysis of data, appropriate design and execution of experiments, appropriate documentation of experimental plans and results, interpretation of data and presentation and communication of data. Drawing on recent advances in microbiology and immunology, this subject will involve critical review of scientific literature and presentation of such analyses in both an oral and written form. This subject is designed to give level 4 honours\u2019 year experience in skills required for critical analysis and communication of scientific concepts. This subject is designed to provide students with experience to help enable the transition from undergraduate to postgraduate study.</p>",
        "<p>This subject is taken together with BIOM40001 Introduction to Biomedical Research.</p>"
