    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is a general introduction to psycholinguistics. We will study the ways in which language is represented and processed in real time and discuss the factors that enable us to comprehend and use the language. Topics include word processing, sentence processing, discourse processing, linguistic relativity, and non-literal language processing by monolingual and bilingual speakers. Practical training will be provided to familiarize students with a variety of tasks and techniques associated with this field. Students will learn to use the research techniques to design behavioural psycholinguistic experiments. </p>"
