    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides an introduction to quantitative data analysis for the social sciences, focusing on the data and techniques commonly used in analysis of cities. It develops understanding and skill in the use of the collection, interpretation, analysis, and representation of information.</p>",
        "<p>The subject is presented in two parts. Part 1 introduces common demographic and economic data available from secondary sources, including Census data. Students learn the fundamentals of data analysis, including how to define units of analysis, develop appropriate quasi-experimental designs, and construct reliable and valid indicators. Students also learn techniques for analysing and interpreting population data, as well as population forecasting techniques.</p>",
        "<p>Part 2 provides an introduction to basic statistical analysis of small-sample and large-sample data. Topics include descriptive statistics, confidence intervals and power, hypothesis testing, measures of association, and an introduction to regression techniques</p>"
