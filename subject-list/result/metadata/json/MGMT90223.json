    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject offers a foundational overview of the Design Thinking framework including techniques and methods associated with problem solving and innovation. This course takes a \u2018learn by doing\u2019 approach to put the methodology into practice and requires significant group work and practice outside of lecture hours.</p>",
        "<p>What is a wicked problem? How do you know when you have identified a problem worth solving for? More importantly, how do you then solve that problem? What does good design look like? How do you know that your solution is worth pursuing? In this subject we address these questions by adopting a Design Thinking approach and tapping in to the inner creativity and designer that resides in all of us. </p>",
        "<p>Design Thinking is a creative approach to problem solving that puts the end user at the heart of everything we do. It aids us in the innovation process by continually exploring and challenging status quo while focussing on underlying human needs. The subject begins by exploring the foundational framework of design thinking and the mindset required to step outside of your comfort zone and into ambiguity. We highlight the significance of human-centred design principles to understand \u2018wicked problems\u2019 including deep empathy through ethnographic research techniques. We examine various forms of prototyping and their capacity to be generative of innovative solutions. We will also interrogate assumptions, generate insights, and transform these into opportunities for innovation. A significant proportion of the subject will be devoted to practicing design-thinking techniques outside of lecture. Students will undertake a critical analysis of a \u2018wicked problem\u2019 and use design-thinking principles to create, iterate and test an innovative solution.</p>"
