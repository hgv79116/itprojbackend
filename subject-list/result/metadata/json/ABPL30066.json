        "<p>This lecture and tutorial course will develop a basic understanding of how architecture acts as part of the political and cultural processes for all societies, particularly western culture. The course will investigate the legacy of classical western architecture and how its development is both formal and political in its consequences. The course will look at the relationships of architecture to power structures and how architecture and spatial order are reflective of the social and moral relationships within a society. This non-linear history will also examine the disruptive impacts of non-western architecture and will challenge the presumptions of eternal truths and destiny for western architecture. In doing so, the course will offer a re-appraisal of architectural lineage, tradition, style and values.</p>"
