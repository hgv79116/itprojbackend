        "<p>Historically a computer was \u201cprogrammed\u201d by a human utilising a precise set of instructions. Within this paradigm the computer was able to \u201cprocess\u201d information \u201cfed\u201d to it and produce a particular output based on such programming and information.</p>",
        "<p>The human input was clear and transparent. As artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved in concert with the internet, cloud computing, big data gathering, data storage and data processing capabilities and the ubiquitous uptake of interactive smartphones and other \u201csmart\u201d devices, the relationship between the computer and direct and immediate human stewardship or control of outputs has become less readily identifiable. In turn this has given rise to significant legal issues.</p>",
        "<p>There are substantial legal implications of AI which require ongoing, flexible and informed responses from lawyers and legal policy makers. This subject seeks to inform practicing lawyers, legal policy makers and non-lawyers in respect of those issues and how they might be dealt with.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Introduction to AI. What is AI? Where is AI headed?</li><li>The legal issues raised by AI</li><li>The ethical issues raised by AI and particular applications of AI</li><li>Overview of current AI legal reviews underway in the USA, EU and UK and Australia\u2019s response to these reviews</li><li>Intellectual property issues raised by AI</li><li>Criminal liability in respect of AI</li><li>Civil legal liability \u2013 examination of who is (or should be) responsible/liable for AI caused loss and harm.</li><li>Mandatory insurance schemes for loss or damage caused by autonomous robots or AI</li><li>The legal regimes governing use of AI in security, law enforcement and military contexts</li><li>Privacy and confidentiality implications of AI</li></ul>"
