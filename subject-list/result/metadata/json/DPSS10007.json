        "<p>Cool is an elusive essence recognised in artists, musicians, actors and other icons that generations have attempted to capture.</p>",
        "<p>This online subject will examine the history of cool from its roots to its continuing influence through the lens of one of its most visible products \u2013 fashion. Through study of the icons of cool in mainstream Western consciousness, you will examine the history of what we have found cool, the fashions that retain the aura of cool today, and how these elements in turn reflect what we have found desirable.</p>",
        "<p>Disclaimer: This subject is not guaranteed to make you cool, but it will help you understand what it is.</p>"
