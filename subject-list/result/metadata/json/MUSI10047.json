        "<p>This subject examines music, culture and society in Western Europe and its areas of influence from the seventeenth to the late eighteenth centuries. By examining musical works, historical documents, and modern scholarship, students explore the development of musical styles and performance practices during this period.</p>",
        "<p>In-class discussions, quizzes, and exercises support students as they examine current scholarship on authenticity and performance practice, music and politics, gender and sexuality, and music and meaning.</p>",
        "<p>Students engage in an individual project on a work relevant to them, which they explore from performative, historical and analytical perspectives. Three tutorial assignments support them through the research process, culminating in the final essay.</p>"
