    "overview": [
        "<p>By the conclusion of this subject students will have explored the nexus between clinical condition and bench research. Students will be presented with a series of clinical cases or physiological challenges and will examine the underlying physiological dysregulation in each scenario. Working in teams, students will develop a set of questions about the clinical presentation, will draw on their collective existing knowledge of human physiology, examine the limits of existing contemporary research to formulate their own explanation of the underlying pathophysiology, and propose novel research approaches to better understand the mechanisms physiological regulation and dysregulation.</p>"
