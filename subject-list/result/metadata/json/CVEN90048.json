    "overview": [
        "<p>The aim of this subject is to provide students with an introduction to urban traffic engineering and transport planning principles. General theory as well as analytical techniques for solving common transport engineering and modelling problems are presented. The key theme in this subject is how to improve the efficiency and sustainability of transport systems. This includes basics of traffic flow theory, simulation, and operation models, and understanding and predicting travel demand in urban transport networks. Behavioural choice modelling methods are used with real data from the Melbourne Metropolitan Area to predict demand for all modes of transport including public transport and non-motorised transport modes. The concepts of accessibility, efficiency and sustainability are introduced in the context of urban transport systems, and transport safety measures and best practices are also introduced.</p>"
