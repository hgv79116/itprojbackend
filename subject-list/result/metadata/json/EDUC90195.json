    "overview": [
        "<p>Responsive teaching in literacy is critical not only for sustainable learning, but also for the social emotional wellbeing of diverse learners experiencing learning difficulties in reading and/or writing including dyslexia. Evidence-based assessment and intervention enables practitioners to meet diverse learners at their points of need and guides change for inclusive practices through Multi-Tiered Systems of Support.</p>",
        "<p>This subject draws on contemporary theories and explanations of the impact of learning difficulties and disabilities on literacy and examines their underpinning assumptions and implications for assessment, instruction, intervention, engagement, and wellbeing of learners. Specifically, an explicit structured approach will be taken to building foundational skills of oral language, phonology (phonological and phonemic awareness), sound-symbol associations (phonics) as well as morphology, semantics (the structure, use and meaning of words), syntax (sentences) and discourse level processes across both reading and writing. Relevant diagnostic and instructional models are critiqued in terms of their theoretical bases, empirical support and implications for implementation. Knowledge will be applied through practical assessment tasks using a clinical teaching approach within their own settings and with their diverse learners. The subject concludes with strategies for implementing change at a broader level to more effectively meet the needs of learners experiencing literacy learning difficulties. </p>"
