        "<p>Leadership &amp; Change explores the role of leaders and the process of leadership in impacting and influencing organisational performance. In today\u2019s leaner and flatter organisations, leaders require much more than just the authority associated with their position to be effective. The aim of this course is to examine the theory and practice of how leaders and leadership make a difference, with the explicit goal of having students reflect on their own leadership challenges and capabilities. Three themes underpin the subject content, process and assessment: 1. personal reflection is the basis for growth, learning and development as a leader; 2. learning comes from experience, and experiential activities and insights from the \u201chere and now\u201d; and 3. leadership involves questioning premises and initiating new directions rather than just implementing pre-determined trajectories.</p>"
