        "<p>Managing student performance can be challenging at many levels. Poorly performing or dis-engaged students may increase clinical risk, require intensive support, negatively impact teamwork both in the classroom and in the workplace, reduce productivity and lower morale. A recent survey at the College identified that identification and management of poorly performing trainees was one of surgical educators\u2019 greatest challenges. This subject has been developed to provide surgical educators with the tools and skills to minimise the likelihood of students under-performing and to provide strategies to manage such students when they are identified. This subject explores ways to support trainees who are not progressing as expected. This is an opportunity to develop high level skills in learner-centred education. Theory and skills acquired in core subjects are applied in the context of managing the under performing trainee. In some ways this subject is an extended \u2018master class\u2019 in learner-centred support. Unlike many other professions, underperforming surgical trainees in the workplace can increase patient safety risk. Surgical educators need to be actively involved in strategies to engage their students, to identify and develop strategies to manage students experiencing difficulties and to balance trainee educational needs with safe clinical practice.</p>",
        "<p>The overall aims of this subject are:</p>",
        "<ul><li>To explore and understand typical characteristics and motivations of underperforming students</li><li>To develop teaching strategies that encourage participation</li><li>To identify and implement a range of educational methods to support and manage underperforming students</li></ul>"
