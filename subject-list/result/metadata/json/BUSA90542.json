        "<p>This component builds on the material in Statistical Learning for Business and covers advanced analytic methods. It extends the statistical learning component of Business Analytics Foundations in three ways. First, new techniques such as tree based methods and neural networks are introduced. Second, students will be introduced to unsupervised statistical learning techniques and third, students will learn how to combine models and techniques to produce ensembles with better predictive capabilities.</p>"
