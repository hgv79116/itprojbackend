    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces students to the Still Life genre explored from a 21st Century perspective. <br/><br/>Engaging drawing and painting techniques and processes, this subject is designed for students who have little or no practical experience in art making. Commencing with observational drawing, students will be introduced to ways of visualizing relevant, abstract concepts as they relate to the still-life genre.</p>",
        "<p>Multi-disciplinary investigations around the inanimate object will also focus on the dynamics of colour and pictorial space. Theoretical discussions will explore the human relationship to abstract ideas and the evolution of the still life convention. Projects will be set in both practical and theoretical areas.</p>",
        "<p>Students will participate in classes, engage with content including demonstrations, discussions and lectures. Ongoing feedback will be provided.</p>",
