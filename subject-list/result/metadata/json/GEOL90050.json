        "<p>This is an intensive 12-day field trip to New Zealand, one of the best natural laboratories in which to learn about geology. Apart from being dramatically different to Australia in terms of modern day geological activity, it is a ribbon continent with a complex assembly of allochthonous terranes, part of which was formerly part of Australia. It has hyperactive back arc volcanism, spectacular geothermal activity, very active seismicity and is one of the few countries in the world with glaciers at sea level. Some of the main concepts to be covered will be:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Arcs and back-arc architecture, seismicity and volcanism</li><li>Transpressional fault systems</li><li>Geothermal springs and geothermal power</li><li>The relationship of these to ore deposits</li><li>Glaciers as a record of Holocene climate change</li><li>Seismic hazards and engineering responses</li></ul>"
