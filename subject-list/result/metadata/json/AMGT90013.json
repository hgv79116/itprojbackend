        "<p>This subject introduces students to the fundamentals of financial management and budgeting in arts organisations. Commencing with an examination of the principal financial reports, the subject takes students through the nature and type of transactions undertaken by arts organisations, how these transactions are recorded in financial statements and the steps necessary to prudently manage arts organisations. In the second half of the semester, students examine the preparation and evaluation of financial budgets in arts organisations. Specifically, students address the budgeting process, budget preparation and the use of financial and performance measurement systems.</p>"
