        "<p>This subject provides an introduction to the theory, experimental design and practice of techniques used in molecular biology and genetic analysis. Students work collaboratively to perform a series of laboratory-based practicals to explore fundamental principles in genetics and molecular genetic analysis of microorganisms and higher organisms.  A key component of this subject is the development of analytical skills associated with the interpretation of genetic data and the communication of results.</p>"
