    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject, which is offered to students who have completed ENGR90034 Creating Innovative Engineering (CIE), will give participants core leadership skills for managing professionals engaged in innovation and other ambiguous project-based work. </p>",
        "<p>The subject teaches leadership at three levels (12 hours each).  The first level, taught intensively before the start of the semester, will enable you to learn basic management theory that allows you to bridge from the skills and theory taught in CIE to the level needed to start mentoring a team in CIE or another subject.  The second level, taught as four three-hour workshops during the semester, will focus on key thematic issues in the leadership of innovative teams.  The third level, taught in twelve one-hour sessions, will focus on specific leadership skills.  These include facilitation, coaching, mentoring, conflict resolution, etc.  Students will apply the theory and skills to the mentoring of a student project team in CIE or another subject within the University.  </p>",
        "<p>You will apply what you are learning, and develop skills, by mentoring an industry-sponsored project within CIE or a project within another subject.  CIE mentors will also need to manage their relationship with the external sponsor of the project.</p>"
