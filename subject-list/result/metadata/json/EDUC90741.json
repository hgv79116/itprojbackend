    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject lays a firm foundation for further studies in the education of health professionals. The basics of teaching and learning theory are presented with clear linkages to the clinical workplace to ensure immediate relevance and applicability.</p>",
        "<p>An engaging mix of seminars, workshops, on-line learning and practical activities in the workplace meets the needs of clinicians who teach learners at any level, while an intensive option might appeal to those with limited availability.</p>",
        "<p>In recognition of the occupational demands on busy clinicians, contact days will typically occur on consecutive days at the Parkville campus during the semester with 4 hours devoted to this subject on each of the days.</p>",
        "<p>Teaching will be split between lectures (1 hour), seminars or symposia (1 hour), and small group work (2 hours).<br/><br/><br/></p>"
