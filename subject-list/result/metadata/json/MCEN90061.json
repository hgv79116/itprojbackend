        "<p>Mechatronics Systems Design uses a project-based learning approach to enable students to experience the integrated design process of mechatronics systems and acquire relevant knowledge and skills. Students will come to appreciate various components of mechatronics systems, such as sensors and actuators and will learn the fundamental principles, operating characteristics, strengths and weaknesses of these components.</p>",
        "<p><br/>Students will learn about important aspects of the design process, including integrated iterative design, division a system into sub-systems, component selection and sizing, and the inclusion of various considerations into a quantifiably justified design.</p>",
        "<p><br/>The subject also provides wider background knowledge of mechatronics, exposing the students to the current state-of-the-art and current challenges. Continuous assessment based on design exercises with increasing degrees of complexity will bring the lecture material into practice.</p>"
