        "<p>Note: This subject is only available to students enrolled in the Doctor of Optometry.</p>",
        "<p>In this subject, students will continue to integrate their knowledge of clinical vision sciences into an understanding of the diagnosis and management of ocular and visual system disease and will refine their clinical diagnostic skills. They will complete study in the areas of anterior and posterior eye disease, contact lenses, paediatrics, neurological disorders and low vision. Students will also study professional practice, including the role of optometry in the health care system and the community, the role of government and professional bodies, visual standards, communication, and ethical and cultural considerations in optometry. Throughout this subject, students will be required to demonstrate a high standard in clinical techniques and their capacity to apply these methods to the examination and management of patients. Additionally, students will work in small groups and as individuals to explore the evidence-based management of clinical cases. </p>"
