    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject covers recent advances in the application of genetics and breeding technologies to commercial animal improvement programs including: advanced reproductive technologies, quantitative and molecular genetics. Students will develop the skills to evaluate the potential impact of recent breeding technologies on breeding program design. Practical sessions aim to develop skills in the interpretation of genetic data and to gain knowledge of how reproductive systems can be manipulated to implement advanced breeding technologies, such as multiple ovulation and embryo transfer, cloning and transgenesis.</p>",
