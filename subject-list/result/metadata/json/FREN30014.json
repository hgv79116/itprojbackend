    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject examines how travel writing translates the world into words, and as such is a key to understanding international relations and intercultural communication. Focusing mainly on contemporary texts but also referring to classical French travel literature, it introduces students to a wide range of fictional and non-fictional travel narratives in French set in various geographical locations. Texts range from explorer\u2019s accounts to contemporary travel tales, together with examples from comics (Tintin), cinema, fiction and journalism. Students are encouraged to pursue reading and assessment tasks that coincide with their own interests for past, present and future travel destinations. Students will study theoretical, anthropological, philosophical and literary texts in this field to develop a sound understanding of the intercultural, (post)colonial and geopolitical issues that may be presented through travel writing and the encounter with the Other. This subject is taught in French.</p>"
