        "<p>This subject provides an introduction  to nuclear science and engineering. It presents the properties of atomic nuclei, radioactivity, nuclear reactions, and selected topics in thermodynamics as required for the analysis of power systems based on nuclear fission. The working principles of nuclear reactors and nuclear power plants are discussed, focusing on pressurised-water reactor systems.</p>",
