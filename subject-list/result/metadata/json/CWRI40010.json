    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject deals with a range of forms within the growing field of environmental writing. The subject is seminar-based and engages with the concept of 'environmental writing' in three ways: 1) consideration of place-based and environmental research and writing practices across multiple genres, 2) examination of the environmental, political, ethical and ideological narratives that sub-tend everyday life and 3) examination of students own relationship to the environments they research and write. Themes and texts that may be included in subject reading material will be essays and interviews that address the production and craft of environmental writing. The subject will also explore a diverse range of genres including personal essay, poetry, fiction and graphic narrative that are produced around social, ethical, ideological and psychological themes related to Earth's many and varied environments.</p>"
