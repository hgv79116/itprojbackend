        "<p>This will include the development of:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Strategies for singers to achieve foundational interactive voice, lyric diction and body work for stage productions; OR</li><li>Strategies for repetiteurs to work at a foundational level to play keyboard parts and full orchestral scores in a spontaneous rehearsal context, and to learn how to negotiate complex ensemble interactions and dynamics in the rehearsal room.</li></ul>",
        "<p>To achieve these goals, students will work in group contexts to consolidate and develop:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Foundation skills in vocal delivery and acting with appropriate stylistic approaches</li><li>Foundation skills in the interactions between singing, speech, lyric diction and text appropriate to the demands of either baroque/classical, or romantic/twentieth-century operatic works.</li></ul>"
