        "<p>This is structured in three phases:</p>",
        "<ol><li>Human perception of multimedia (vision and hearing), which establishes a set of fundamental requirements for signal structure, sampling and fidelity</li><li>Technologies common to the representation and delivery of multimedia are introduced, including media formats, data compression, data description, copyright protection, streaming, content delivery networks and error recovery</li><li>The major categories of multimedia service (Internet streaming, broadcast television, videoconferencing, Video-on-demand, etc.) are analysed, recognising the role of the above technologies in these systems and introducing additional components necessary to satisfy customers or users of the services</li></ol>",
        "<p><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT</strong></p>",
