        "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This course aims to introduce the student to processes of atmosphere-ocean interaction, their importance in the climate system and its variability, with a particular emphasis on tropical meteorology. Specific topics will include: wind and buoyancy driven ocean circulation, atmospheric convection, atmospheric and oceanic wave phenomena, SST and atmospheric circulation, El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), decadal to centennial scale variability and large scale modelling.</p>"
