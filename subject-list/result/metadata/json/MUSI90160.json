This practicum representing the foundational experience. </p>",
        "<p>Students undertaking this subject will work on a practical project, through rehearsals and culminating in a performance, in order to develop, consolidate and apply the individual skills required for an opera production.</p>",
        "<p>Through involvement with an opera production through an in-house University production, vocal students will strengthen and consolidate a breadth of skills and knowledge regarding stylistic vocal delivery, stagecraft and movement training, role development and characterisation, and ensemble work. Students will receive the technical and artistic training to cope with all interpretive demands of the production.</p>",
        "<p>Through involvement with an opera production through an in-house University production, repetiteur students will strengthen and consolidate their skills in orchestral reduction and vocal score realisation, as well as their knowledge and understandings of the rehearsal process, as applicable to all aspects of the repetiteurs' craft. Students will receive the technical and artistic training to cope with all interpretive demands of the production.</p>"
