        "<p>This subject focuses on the application of economics to the analysis of policy issues facing governments in Australia and overseas.

It then explores in detail specific topics drawn from health economics, microeconomic reform, income distribution, poverty or other relevant policy areas. For each specific topic the subject presents and evaluates results in the literature and analyses future policy options and their effects.</p>"
