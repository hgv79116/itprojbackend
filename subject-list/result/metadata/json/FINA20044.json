    "overview": [
        "<p>This practice-based drawing subject focuses on developing skills and techniques in botanical drawing, using drawing and watercolour media. Students will be introduced to specialist botanical drawing techniques, working from live plants and botanical specimens and engaging with the University Cultural Collections (including the University of Melbourne Herbarium (MELU) and the University of Melbourne System Garden).</p>",
        "<p>Lectures and writing tasks that explore the botanical in historic and contemporary visual art will complement the drawing program. By the end of the subject, students should have developed a comprehensive folio of exercises and finished works exploring the botanical in both its living and preserved states, highlighting how artistic practice can be used as a space for exploration and discovery.</p>",
        "<p>Though this subject is designed for students who have little or no drawing experience, it will also suit students who have previously undertaken a visual art Breadth subject or similar.</p>",
        "<p>Students will participate in classes, and engage with content including demonstrations, discussions, tours and lectures. Ongoing feedback will be provided.</p>"
