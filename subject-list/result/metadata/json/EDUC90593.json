    "overview": [
        "<p>The Developing Clinical Practice subject provides the arena in which all the other subjects in the program are integrated into participants\u2019 developing expertise as a classroom teacher, and their developing understandings of professional knowledge, professional practice and professional engagement. As clinical practice is the foundation of Faculty of Education\u2019s MTeach programs, this subject is underpinned with the core conviction that each and every student can learn, and will learn through teaching interventions that are derived from classroom data and research evidence.</p>",
        "<p>Prior to employment, participants undertake a one-week school placement, enabling them to observe teaching and learning, to collaborate with school staff and familiarise themselves with the school community, school culture, organisation and policies. During the summer program participants will observe teaching demonstrations both on campus and through field experiences. Participants have opportunities to learn about experiential and inquiry- based learning pedagogies, and to develop team and co-teaching skills and to deepen their knowledge of collaborative educational processes. They are also encouraged to build their practical skills (such as relationship building and self-care). During the Session 1 learning block, Clinical Specialists and Transition Mentors assist participants, to plan for the commencement of their employment, providing advice regarding school context and supporting participants\u2019 preparation of lessons and units of work.</p>",
        "<p>In schools, participants are supported by Clinical Specialists in the first two years, and School Mentors over the three years. They are assisted to make an effective transition to the teaching role through intensive assistance provided by the Support Team, including the development and implementation of an Individualised Induction and Professional Learning Plan and the establishment of clinical teaching practice. In addition, participants have opportunities to observe demonstrations of quality teaching, by lead / expert teachers from the school or nearby schools. Clinical Specialists and Mentors organise these demonstrations as well as providing regular feedback on teaching practice and professional conduct.</p>",
        "<p>Through direct practical teaching, participants are supported to transfer knowledge gained through coursework into skilled practice. The assessment tasks associated with this subject are designed to build capacity for clinical judgement and practice. Participants reflect on observations of teaching practice, receive feedback on their teaching and evaluate their own teaching practice in the context of the Australian Graduate Standards for Teachers. They produce a portfolio as evidence of their professional development as teachers.</p>",
