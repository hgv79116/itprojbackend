        "<p>For lawyers, being able to effectively communicate the law to non-lawyers is an important skill and central to all types of legal practice.  Governments have an obligation to ensure that people understand the laws that affect them; judges and courts must communicate the reasons for their decisions; law firms produce updates for clients on changes to the law and community legal centres seek to empower their clients to uphold their rights and protect their interests.   For the community, legal literacy is an essential component of ensuring access to justice for all.  In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, Community Legal Education (CLE) might involve audio and visual resources, digital and graphic communications and social media, as well as face-to-face events and presentations.  In Street Law, students will learn about the theory and practice of CLE and its role in supporting access to justice.  Students will then work with community organisations and the subject coordinator to identify, design, develop and present one or more CLE presentations or resources.  Students will work in small groups and will be responsible for managing all aspects of the CLE project, including liaising with partner organisations to confirm the brief, researching the law, developing an engaging and effective resource and presenting this to the target audience.</p>",
        "<p>Specific topics to be covered will change from year to year depending on community needs and student interest.</p>"
