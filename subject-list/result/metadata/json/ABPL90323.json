    "overview": [
        "<p>Through an introduction to details of construction scheduling techniques and use of professional scheduling tools, this subject articulates the clear processes of logical development of time program for construction activities in projects. Real-life case projects are used for students to explore the concepts of activity definition, activity sequencing, resource allocation and resource leveling in the time schedule development process. Organised as a working seminar, the subject exposes students to clear visualisation of the construction processes and logical placement of construction activities whilst enabling them to understand underlying constraints in the schedule development context.</p>",
