Modern businesses\u2019 business processes and activities usually involve multiple streams of data from areas as diverse as marketing activities, operational processes and financial activities. Therefore, managers are frequently confronted with how to harness these to understand their business better, so that they can make more informed decisions. Data analysis is the process of converting such raw data into meaningful information to inform business decision-making.</p>",

These skills are essential both for later MBA subjects, and also for solving managerial problems in your later career. The course is computer based and students are required to perform all manipulations and computations themselves.</p>"
