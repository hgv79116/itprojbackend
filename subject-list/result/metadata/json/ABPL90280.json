    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject explores the histories not only of particular cities but also more broadly the historical development of spatial and social features of cities. Elements developed over time in both Australian and international urban areas are countenanced with a view to understanding how these have worked and might continue to work \u2013 through adaptation, reinvigoration, or refinement \u2013 in the urban context. The central question of the appeal and value of the city in the past and present is at the forefront. Understanding of city culture and the quality of the urban fabric over time is emphasised.</p>",
        "<p>50% of the assessment of this course comes from a creative work produced individually by students which reflects on, and engages with, themes explored in the course: cities, creativity, society, history, urbanity, and culture. </p>",
        "<p><em>Please note that this subject is only available to students admitted into a course at the Melbourne School of Design.</em></p>"
