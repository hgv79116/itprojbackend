Students will learn to apply text analysis, text typology, and contrastive analysis of their working languages to identify, analyse, and resolve translation and interpreting problems while independently developing an efficient and rational approach to the process of written and oral translation.</p>"

Students will develop cross-cultural and cross-linguistic sensitivity",
        "Decision making: Translators and interpreters are creative decision-makers who need to draw on multiple sources of data to form judgments that are seldom clear-cut. They are prepared to defend their decisions and to revise them when necessary."
