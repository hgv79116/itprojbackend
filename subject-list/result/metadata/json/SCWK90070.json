    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject aims to give students an appreciation of the nature of human service organisations as a context, vehicle and target of social work interventions. Several theoretical perspectives on human service organisations will be explored and students will be introduced to a number of specific dimensions useful in understanding organisations, like goals, mission, technology and culture. They will also examine the different ways in which such organisations are structured for line and task accountability and what difference the overall size of the organisation makes for both workers and clients. The environment in which an organisation operates and its inter-organisational field are of increasing importance in human service practice and different ways of understanding and conceptualizing the environment will be presented. The clients/consumers/target groups of human service organisation have a major influence on program design and choice of technology. Similarly, the way in which work is structured in the organisation will have a particular impact on staff in terms of the manner in which they interact with colleagues and manage their time and stresses of the job. Utilisation of supervision and the nature of interdisciplinary teamwork will be particularly explored. Finally, the course will explore how change within the organisation can be initiated, implemented and evaluated.</p>"
