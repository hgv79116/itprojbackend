    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject builds on the skills introduced in the subject, Principles of Clinical Audiology. Students will continue to develop skills in the theory and practice of audiological evaluation and management of adult patients. This subject will expand on the audiological test battery covered in Principles of Clinical Audiology, to include how results integration and clinical reasoning enable management decision making for adult audiology patients. Further, clinical communication skills will continue to be developed for clinician patient interactions in clinical settings. This subject also introduces students to the principles and practices of clinical education. Students will gain clinical experience in the assessment and management of hearing and balance disorders in the adult population.</p>"
