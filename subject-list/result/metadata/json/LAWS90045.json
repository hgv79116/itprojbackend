    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will draw attention to how and why the relationship between human rights and many marginalised groups has been highly fraught and replete with tensions. The subject will explore and unpack two central claims on which human rights law is based: first, that human rights are universal; and secondly, that human rights are an optimistic, progressive and emancipatory pursuit. These claims will be interrogated by focusing on the treatment of difference in international human rights law, including differences of gender, culture, indigeneity, sexual orientation, gender identity and religion, exploring how the `Other\u2019 has been addressed in human rights law. Students will examine how the universality of international human rights law might yet be realised and learn how to grapple with some of the challenges posed by those who argue against universality, claiming i) that human rights are culturally specific to the West, and therefore inappropriate in non-Western cultural contexts; ii) that human rights are a ruse for pursuing neo-imperial or neo-liberal agendas; and iii) that human rights are exclusive and available to some humans, not all humans.</p>",
