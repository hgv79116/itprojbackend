        "<p>Medical research studies can be split into five distinct phases\u2014conception, design, execution, analysis, and publication/reporting. The quality of a study is highly dependent on the selection of a proper study design and this in turn is determined by the research question to be answered.</p>",
        "<p>This subject will introduce participants to the principles of research within a clinical (ie health) setting, in particular:</p>",
        "<ul><li>turning an idea into a research question that is measurable and evaluable</li><li>examine different study designs used in clinical/medical research</li><li>selecting a study design appropriate to answering the research question</li><li>refining a research question by examining the current literature through the construction of a 'literature review' of published scientific studies</li><li>assessing the strengths, weakness and biases of qualitative and quantitative study designs commonly encountered in the medical literature</li><li>literature searching and critical appraisal of published scientific</li></ul>",
        "<p>This subject provides individuals from medical and allied health professions (such as nurses, pharmacists, physiotherapists etc) and others with a biomedical science-based background with a conceptual framework in research which is undertaken in clinical and medical settings. This subject serves as a basis for advanced study in the Graduate Certificate in Clinical Research, the Graduate Diploma in Clinical Research and the Master of Clinical Research.</p>"
