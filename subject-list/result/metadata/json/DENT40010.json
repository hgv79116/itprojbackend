    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject aims to provide opportunities for students to gain an understanding in, and extend the practice of oral health research. Students are are required to complete a research project and to produce a written thesis under the guidance of their supervisor(s). The research component offers students the opportunity to use state-of-the-art scientific techniques in methods appropriate to their research. This may include qualitative, quantitative, biomedical, experimental, epidemiological or translational research.  Biomedical research may include protein chemistry, biochemistry, biophysics, molecular biology, microbiology, immunology, genetics, anatomy, mass spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy, molecular modelling, skeletal biology, histomorphometry, image analysis, vaccines, biofilms, biophysics and proteomics.</p>"
