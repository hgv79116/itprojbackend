    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject builds upon the knowledge and skills developed in EDUC90904 Introduction to Clinical Practice and EDUC90906 Integrating Language &amp; Clinical Practice to support Teacher Candidates to become clinical practitioners. In so doing, Teacher Candidates will demonstrate their use of the Clinical Judgement for Teaching Cycle as a guide to interventionist assessment and pedagogical and instructional decision-making. Specifically, Teacher Candidates will demonstrate growing proficiency in knowledge and understanding of legislative requirements and teaching strategies necessary for orchestrating inclusive classrooms. They will develop curriculum, assessment and reporting knowledge to design differentiated learning interventions that meet the needs of learners and particularly support the participation and learning of students with disability.</p>",
        "<p>In becoming clinical practitioners, Teacher Candidates will also develop capabilities which will prepare them to identify the scope of learning needs within a student group; the suitability of evidence collection for informing clinical judgement; and evidence-based learning progressions. The theme of the content presented in this core subject is 'student data and interventionist practice'.</p>"
