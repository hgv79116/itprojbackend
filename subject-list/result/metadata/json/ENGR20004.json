        "<p>The aim of this subject is to provide an introduction to modelling the stresses and deformations that occur when axial, torsional and flexural loads are applied to a body in static equilibrium, as well as the translational and rotational motions that eventuate in a body subject to different load applications. This material will be complemented with laboratory and project based approaches to learning.</p>",
        "<p>The subject provides the basis for all the mechanical engineering subjects that follow. The calculations introduced in this subject are the most common type of calculations performed by professional mechanical engineers in all sectors of the industry.</p>",
        "<p><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT<br/><br/></strong>Topics to be covered include free-body diagrams; equilibrium; force systems; stresses and strains; coordinate systems; statically indeterminate systems; flexure; bending under combine loads; torsion; power transmission; kinematics; relative motion; particle kinetics; impulse and momentum; vibration; rigid body motion; angular impulse and momentum; work and energy.</p>",
