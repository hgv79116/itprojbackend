        "<p>For at least two hundred years science has explored ways to breed better humans; to make Homo sapiens stronger and healthier. On the face of it, this looks like a Good Thing. Who wouldn\u2019t wish everyone to be the best they can\u2014fit, healthy, and free from disease? And, if you could wipe out hereditary conditions, wouldn\u2019t you do it? But the seemingly noble aim of improving the human species has often resulted in malign political programmes targeting vulnerable groups including people with disabilities, people suffering from mental ill-health, and LGBTQI+ people. At its most extreme\u2014the Nazi death camps and settler-colonial dispossession of first nations\u2019 peoples\u2014the desire to \u201cimprove\u201d the species has led to genocide. We will explore this disturbing history right up to the present day, unpacking the relationship between science and politics whenever the idea of breeding better humans has been mooted. This subject is entirely online, and is focused upon developing research and communication skills, whilst enhancing your ethical understanding of the world. It will be of interest to students across a wide range of disciplines, from the sciences to the humanities.</p>"
