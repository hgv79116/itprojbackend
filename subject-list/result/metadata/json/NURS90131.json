    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces students to the concepts of acute and chronic illness in individuals across the life-span. The subject focuses on the <em>National Health Priorities, </em>giving<em> s</em>tudents the opportunity to examine the principles and practices underpinning the sociocultural context of patient care. Knowledge is developed in relation to high risk groups, including patients experiencing cardiovascular disorders, asthma and diabetes. Content includes strategies for injury prevention and control, risk reduction and early detection of key health issues, peri-operative care, admission and discharge planning, self-care management, community health and support services and models of collaborative care. Students will continue to refine and expand their knowledge and competency in patient assessment, problem identification, clinical decision making, nursing intervention selection, medication administration and practice evaluation in the context of acute and chronic illness. Knowledge and skills related to fundamental nursing practices will be consolidated and extended. Concepts are patient focused, evidence based and designed to give students the skills to deliver safe, effective high quality care to individuals with acute and chronic health issues.</p>",
        "<p>In the <em><strong>simulated learning laboratory</strong></em> students will develop skills relating to specific medical/surgical nursing interventions.</p>",
        "<p>During the <strong><em>professional experience placement,</em></strong> under the guidance of clinical educators and clinical preceptors, students will gain experience in settings that enable them to meet the learning outcomes specific to this subject. The major focus for the professional experience placement component of this subject is the integration of the principles of medical/surgical nursing, clinical decision making, and more complex nursing interventions. On completion of the subject it is expected that students, while providing therapeutic interventions, are able to incorporate the further collection of health assessment data and adjust care accordingly for 2 to 3 patients.</p>"
