Students will explore the pedagogical, social, political, and cultural bases of campaigns for educational justice and equity across different Australian and international case studies. Critically applying the notion of \u2018public pedagogy\u2019, students will investigate how social movements use educational practices and ideas to put forward their agenda for justice and freedom. Using art, historical archives, and campaign materials, students will engage with the diversity of voices and movements that contribute to educational change. This subject will equip students with the knowledge and skills to critically analyse policy reform so as to understand the relationship between history, education, and social movements.</p>"
