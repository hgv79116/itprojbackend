    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject focuses on the interaction between cuisine and nationalist discourses in Spain and Peru, exploring how food can function as a site of control and/or a vehicle for the construction of nationhood. Studies of national cuisines demonstrate that how we talk about food is as revealing of our identity as what we eat. Some important developments in the newly emerging field of Hispanic Cultural Food Studies reveal that gastronomic identities can be mobilised within different social contexts to different political and cultural ends. These range from the prescription and re-description of gender roles to processes of modernisation, from national renewal to questions of national boundaries. Culinary identities in Spain and Peru will also be examined in the context of regional rivalries, regional integration, post-colonial legacies and dictatorial rule.</p>",
        "<p>Academic skills are enhanced through learning how to write scholarly essays in Spanish and to do close readings of a variety of food texts and scholarly and journalistic articles. Workplace-relevant skills are developed through collaborative project-based group work, and investigative and oral skills developed through media that could include podcasts, radio broadcasts, or other journalistic presentations.</p>"
