        "<p>The subject covers both South and North Koreas\u2019 international relations since the establishment of the governments in 1948 until today. It deals with two Koreas\u2019 political and ideological divergence since the end of WWII and how two Koreas have formed two totally different diplomatic, economic and cultural relations with the rest of the world. While the focus is on two Koreas\u2019 relations with Japan, China, the US and Russia, their respective relations with other Asian, European, African and American states will also be discussed. Two Koreas\u2019 relations with Australia will have special attention.</p>"
