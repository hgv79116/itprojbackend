    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject explores the content and pedagogical content knowledge needed to teach <em>Algebra</em> from the <em>Number and Algebra</em> strand in Years 7-10 mathematics, including <em>patterns and algebra</em> and <em>linear and non-linear relationships</em>. Participants will study research on students\u2019 mathematical understanding and effective teaching methods.  Current challenges, issues and opportunities in teaching Algebra will be addressed. The development of targeted teaching approaches for developing algebraic understanding and procedural fluency will be a focus.</p>",
        "<p>Participants will develop pedagogical use of digital technology to support the teaching of algebra. Development of the proficiencies of fluency, understanding, reasoning and problem solving will be considered in the context of <em>Algebra.</em> Approaches for planning units of work in mathematics, including selection and use of appropriate resources will be addressed. Research and practice on teaching for procedural fluency and conceptual understanding will be reviewed. Practical teaching tasks will complement theory.</p>"
