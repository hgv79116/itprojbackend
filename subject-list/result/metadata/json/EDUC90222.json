    "overview": [
        "<p>This unit builds on the assessment, counselling and social context units and has the twin aims of focusing on theory and research as they relate to the treatment of problems of childhood and adolescence. The underlying consideration is prevention rather than cure. For that reason there is an emphasis on developing resilience and psychosocial competence in young people.</p>",
        "<p>The content of the unit deals with an introduction to major approaches such as: Adlerian Psychotherapy, Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, Gestalt Therapy, Systems Theory and Humanistic Psychotherapy. A limited number of approaches to intervention from early childhood (e. g. Play Therapy), through to adulthood (e.g. Cognitive Behaviour Therapy), are considered in greater detail. These approaches are examined as they contribute to the treatment of the major developmental problems of childhood and adolescence and their manifestations in an educational setting, such as, for example, depression, mood disorders, anxiety, PTSD, substance abuse and sleep disorders. Assessment of the problem involves a systemic approach using DSM-V diagnostic criteria, complemented by an understanding of psychopathology and psychopharmacology. An understanding of the genesis and maintenance of problems, taking into account the social context, is the basis for selecting the most appropriate tools for intervention. The focus is on the development of resilience and psychosocial competence.</p>"
