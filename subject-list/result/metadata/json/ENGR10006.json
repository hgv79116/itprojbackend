    "overview": [
        "<p>The subject will develop your understanding of the engineering modelling and design processes by taking you through the life cycle of a real-world engineering project and using a combination of lectures and hands-on workshop sessions.</p>",
        "<p>You will work in a small team of students on one of several interdisciplinary engineering challenges, applying engineering concepts, scientific knowledge and creative problem-solving skills in order to satisfy specific design goals.</p>",
        "<p>Along the way you will gain an understanding of the depth and breadth of the engineering design process, while gaining competency in the technical tools and professional skills required to not only complete the challenge, but more broadly help serve the engineering needs of an increasingly complex society.</p>",
