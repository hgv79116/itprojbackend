    "overview": [
        "<p>Large-scale internal violent conflicts and jihadi terrorism have shaped the security landscape of Southeast Asia in recent decades. Insurgencies, political violence, inter-ethnic and inter-religious conflagrations have typically been confined to a small portion of each nation's territory, but have caused much broader impacts. Jihadi terrorism has added an extra-regional dimension to these violent conflicts, as groups active in distant war zones - such as Islamic State in Iraq and Syam (ISIS) -  inspire and plan attacks in Southeast Asia. </p>",
        "<p>This subject will introduce students to violent conflict and jihadi terrorism in Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Myanmar, and provide students with a detailed framework to analyse and understand these phenomena. Students will also become familiar with responses to contemporary violence and terrorism attempted by governments, international agencies, communities and civil society organisations in the region. As part of the subject, students will interact with authors and practitioners working on violence in the region.</p>"
