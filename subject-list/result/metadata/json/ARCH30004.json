        "<p>This  subject prioritises the sustainable building design process and assessment tools used in the design of <strong>NCC class 1 \u2013 2 buildings</strong>, which include standalone single dwellings and apartment buildings.</p>",
        "<p>The subject combines theoretical knowledge of the environmental performance of residential buildings (such as energy, comfort, water, daylight, waste, ecology, innovation) with a practical understanding of how the industry assesses them in accordance with Town Planning requirements, the Building Code of Australia, NatHERS and other specialised assessment tools. These skills are closely aligned with industry expectations for positions such as: graduates ESD consultant positions in architecture and engineering companies.</p>",
