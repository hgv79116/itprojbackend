        "<p><span>This subject teaches core methods used in economics, finance and business for empirical research and data analysis. Extensions of the multiple regression model are examined. Topics include causal and statistical interpretations of regression models, instrumental variables, panel data and time series regression models and relevant statistical theory. Methods are consolidated through a Capstone project involving hypothesis-formation, real-world data collection, and writing-up the results in a formal report.</span></p>",
