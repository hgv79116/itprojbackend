        "<p>This subject extends notions from calculus, linear algebra and differential equations to study spaces with geometric structures.  The concepts introduced are of great importance in mathematics, physics, and all areas in which local properties of spaces are used to model systems.  </p>",
        "<p>Topics include: smooth manifolds, vector bundles, multilinear algebra; Frobenius\u2019 theorem, exterior differentiation, Lie differentiation, flows of vector fields; connections and curvature; bilinear forms, metrics, length, volume, Levi-Civita connection; parallel transport, geodesics, holonomy; connections on principal bundles; examples including Lie groups, hyperbolic geometry and homogeneous spaces.</p>",
        "<p>Additional topics may include: second fundamental form and minimal submanifolds; Jacobi fields and applications to topology; constant curvature and Einstein metrics; Hodge star operator, Hodge Laplacian and harmonic forms; Lorentzian geometry and Einstein's equations; K\u00e4hler geometry; symplectic geometry; gauge theory.</p>",
