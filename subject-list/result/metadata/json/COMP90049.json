        "<p>Machine Learning is the study of making accurate, computationally efficient, interpretable and robust inferences from data, often drawing on principles from statistics. This subject aims to introduce students to the intellectual foundations of machine learning, including the mathematical principles of learning from data, algorithms and data structures for machine learning, and practical skills of data analysis.</p>",
        "<p><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT</strong></p>",
        "<p>Indicative content includes: cleaning and normalising data, supervised learning (classification, regression, linear &amp; non-linear models), and unsupervised learning (clustering), and mathematical foundations for a career in machine learning.</p>"
