        "<p>Periodontics 3 focuses on advanced periodontal and implant procedures to build on the skills developed through the past two years of study. Learning is achieved through a series of weekly 3-hour seminars and clinical placements, which occur throughout the teaching period.</p>",
        "<p>The student will refine their understanding of the complexities of advanced implant dentistry especially surgical placement of implant, bone physiology and healing, implant surfaces and systems. They should have in-depth knowledge about treatment planning for implant treatment, implications with hard and soft tissue grafting and factors that may affect survival and success of procedures.  They will have a thorough understanding of the biological basis of peri-implant disease, from health through to the processes involved in destruction and repair of these tissues and, treatment of peri-implantitis and technical complications associated with implant therapy.</p>",
        "<p>Students will continue to treat patients with periodontal disease, both non-surgically and surgically as well as complex cases and mucogingival procedures, and placement of simple, advanced and complex dental implants throughout the year. Student will gain increased exposure to complicated interdisciplinary treatment cases to throughout the subject.</p>"
