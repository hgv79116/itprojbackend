    "overview": [
        "<p><strong>AIMS</strong><br/><br/>In this subject students will learn about how to evaluate the feasibility of a project and then to define, structure and organise the initial planning phase for both construction projects and complex projects (e.g. IT, high technology projects). The interaction between commercial expectations and project management approaches will be considered broadly based on process and systems thinking. The subject builds on and integrates knowledge from CVEN90043 Sustainable Infrastructure Engineering and/or MCEN90010 Finance and Human Resources for Engineers where the fundamentals of economic appraisal is described, the planning approaches detailed in subject CVEN90045 Engineering Project Implementation and the fundamentals of risk management for which detailed approaches are provided in MULT90014 Business Risk Management. The subject is particularly important for students wishing to understand how to structure and scope projects such that they are well planned on the basis of triple bottom line thinking and the project management processes are efficiently structured.<br/><br/><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT</strong><br/><br/>Techniques considered include the use of logic maps, business cases and system based project management concepts. Details include the development of acquisition strategies, system life-cycle, boundaries, scope management and mechanisms to control of client expectations and assist them to make sound project decisions leading to the sanctioning of a project. Expected value and Monte Carlo techniques are used as tools to refine project decisions based on risk evaluation.<br/><br/>Project governance arrangements are considered along with cultural context, resourcing requirements of a project and how this is organised and managed. Specific areas considered include the selection of consultants or contractors, communication processes, industrial relations, occupational health and safety, meetings, delegation and leadership.<br/><br/></p>"
