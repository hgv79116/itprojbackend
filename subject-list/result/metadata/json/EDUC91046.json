    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject examines the design, delivery, and evaluation of positive interventions and approaches to fostering wellbeing and other positive outcomes across a range of contexts, such as at home, in the workplace, and in the local community. Nuances of delivery format in each delivery setting will be presented, discussed and critiqued. Ethical issues associated with applying positive interventions relevant to each context will be discussed, drawing upon guidelines from various disciplines. Strategies for evaluating the effectiveness, efficacy, and implementation of interventions and programs will be considered. Through experiential approaches, students will gain clarity on the design and implementation of programs, an appreciation of ethical practice, and understanding of basic evaluation skills.</p>"
