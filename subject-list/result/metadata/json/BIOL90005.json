    "overview": [
        "<p>The entire research project for the Master of Science (BioSciences) consists of 125 points with assessments distributed over 4 semesters for full-time, and 5 semesters for part-time.</p>",
        "<p>This subject is part of a sequence taken in successive semesters that together constitute the 125-point research project offered through the MSc Bioscience.</p>",
        "<p>The Research Project involves laboratory or field-based experimental research in an area of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Genetics, Genomics and Developmental Biology, and Plant Biology. The research projects cover a broad range of research from molecular to population and evolutionary biology in micro-organisms, insects, plants and animals.</p>",
        "<p>The project will be based in the laboratory of an academic staff member in the School of BioSciences or an approved external supervisor, depending on the particular research project. The research project aims to develop a range of experimental and technical skills, a capacity to set goals and to design and plan experiments.</p>",
        "<p>Apart from the help and guidance from their supervisor(s) each student also has a committee, which provides additional help and expertise. This committee is responsible for assessment of the research project subject. The subject also provides students with skills and knowledge for understanding original research and enhanced written and oral communication skills.</p>",
        "<p>For full-time students, the project will be taken over four consecutive semesters and will begin on the Monday of the first semester (students can start either semester 1 or semester 2 for mid-year intake) and continue for up to 88 weeks until the end of the fourth semester, minus recreation leave of between 4 and 8 weeks (22 weeks per semester over the four semesters).</p>",
        "<p>For how long and at what time within the enrolment the actual period of leave is to be taken needs to be negotiated with the student\u2019s supervisor.</p>",
        "<p>For part-time students, the project will be taken over five consecutive semesters. This will typically be from Semester 3 to Semester 7 of a 48 month MSc course.</p>",
        "<p>Students will first enrol in BioSciences Research Project Part 1 in their first Research semester, and then progress through to Part 2, Part 3 and Part 4 (and, for part-time students, Part 5). Students may only progress through BioScience Research Project subjects upon successful completion of the earlier project component.</p>",
        "<p>The subject involves experimental research under the direction of a supervisor.</p>"
