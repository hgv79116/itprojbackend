        "<p>This subject illustrates the body of work and research which links human behaviour to the design of the built environment. It explores the history of this research with a focus on  interactions between humans and the physical environment in diverse urban settings. A case study approach is taken to develop insights into ways human environment interaction can be understood and how such information used to inform the evidence-based design of the built environment.</p>"
