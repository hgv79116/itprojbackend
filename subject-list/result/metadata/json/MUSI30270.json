        "<p>The subject is especially designed for students considering honours or graduate research in music, as well as students in history, modern languages, or cultural studies.

        "<p><strong>2023 Topic: Music and meaning from Bach to Beethoven and beyond. </strong></p>",
        "<p>In this subject we will explore the construction of meaning in Western music from the early Modern period to the present through the lens of the theory of musical topics. The concept of <em>topic</em> alludes to conventional figures that refer audiences to culturally shared worlds of meaning. Topical awareness can influence our understanding of individual works and help shape their interpretation. Although our main focus will be the Western art music tradition, the use of topics in other genres such as video game, popular, and film music will be considered. <strong><br/></strong></p>",
        "<p><strong>Delivery</strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject is co-taught with MUSI40111 Honours Music Studies 2. Students cannot simultaneously enrol in co-taught subjects in the same study period.</p>"
