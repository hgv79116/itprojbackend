        "<p>It combines the conceptual and technical skills learnt in Production Studios 1 to 4 as well as those learnt in Production Practice 1 and 2. Students will have the opportunity to further develop their conceptual, technical and management skills through placements in senior level production roles in the creation and realisation of live performance.</p>",
        "<p>In negotiation with the Subject Coordinator, students may propose and undertake a negotiated independent project of a significant scale to independently develop their conceptual, technical and management skills. Students must complete at least one production role.</p>",
        "<p><em>This subject is the second part of a two-subject sequence, taught over two consecutive study periods. Students are required to enrol in DPSS30008 Production Practice 3 - Part A (37.5 points) and DPSS30009 Production Practice 3 - Part B (37.5 points), consecutively, for a total enrolment of 75 points.</em></p>",
