    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is an introduction to engineering materials, statics, mechanics, and structural systems designed for students without a background in engineering, construction or building. It provides a general understanding of engineering materials and discusses how these materials are used in construction. Concepts of mechanic of materials and structural systems will be discussed by drawing on examples in residential and low-rise construction. Various forms of structural systems for timber, reinforced concrete and steel construction will be investigated.</p>"
