        "<p>Treaties have long served as one of the several sources of international law. Increasingly, they have come to serve as the dominant source. Being agreements between states, they are used to regulate all conceivable aspects of international and transnational affairs\u2014bilaterally to effect one-off trades between states (for example the transfer of property) and multilaterally to make rules that aspire to be globally applicable (for example on the suppression of terrorism). This subject aims to consider the treaty from three perspectives. First, it examines the treaty <em>concept</em>, using historical, theoretical and functional materials to assess this instrument\u2019s role in international relations. Second, broadly following the structure of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties \u2013 \u2018the treaty on treaties\u2019 \u2013 this subject examines the \u2018life-cycle\u2019 of treaties from their inception to their termination. Third, this subject examines how domestic legal systems regulate treaty-making and the status, if any, those systems give to treaties themselves. In short, this subject considers what treaties are as well as how they are made, applied and unmade.</p>",
