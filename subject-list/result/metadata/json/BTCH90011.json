    "overview": [
        "<p>Biotechnology enterprises are reliant on new product introduction to maintain competitiveness. New product introduction involves prototyping and/or clinical trials. This subject will enable students to establish capability in the management of testing new products, prototyping, and field and clinical trials. The subject will cover a range of topics including design briefs; target product profiles; prototype development and testing; good regulatory practices and optimally efficient approaches to ensure product under development meets customer needs. The options for the assessment-based learning include three different specialist areas of biotechnology \u2013 therapeutics, medical devices and food &amp; agriculture. Students will receive expert support in these areas to engage in active learning in completing the assessment tasks.</p>"
