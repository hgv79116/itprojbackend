        "<p>A semester-long subject on human neuroanatomy, with particular emphasis on clinical and radiographic correlation. The content will be delivered through 12 lectures, accompanied by virtual brain dissection.</p>",
        "<p>The primary objective of the subject is to provide a neuroanatomical framework that is relevant to an understanding of basic neurology, and clinical neurological examination, and neuropsychological disorders. Neurological, neuropathological, and neuroimaging issues will be considered wherever relevant throughout the subject. Students will come to understand (1) anatomical relations through an appreciation of their developmental origins, (2) the multiple ways in which developmental and acquired brain impairments manifest themselves neuroanatomically, (3) how major anatomical landmarks can be identified on virtual dissection and structural magnetic resonance imaging, (4) the neuroanatomical rationale underpinning the basic neurological examination, and (5) the derivation of neuroanatomical terminology and nomenclature.</p>"
