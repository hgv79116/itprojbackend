        "<p>As well as being beautiful in its own right, algebra is used in many areas of mathematics, computer science and physics. This subject provides a grounding in several fundamental areas of modern advanced algebra including Lie groups, combinatorial group theory, category theory and homological algebra.<br/>The material complements that covered in the subject Commutative and Mutlilinear Algebra without assuming it as prerequisite.</p>"
