        "<p>The rule of law is a hallmark of contemporary Western society. Public perceptions of and attitudes to the law, however, can vary in space and time. This subject explores legal solutions to selected problem scenarios in their broader historical and societal context. The focus is on the main 'families' of law in existence today: the Anglo-American ('common') law and the Continental-European ('civil') law. The use of a comparative approach both facilitates and promotes a deeper understanding of the society in which we live and the rules by which it is shaped.</p>",
        "<p>Particular topics may include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Individual responsibility and the law: risk allocation and blame shifting in personal injury scenarios;</li><li>consumers and the law: liability of manufacturers for defective products;</li><li>morality and the law: the role of good faith in commercial relations;</li><li>strangers and the law: duty to the rescue;</li><li>equality at work: institutionalised forms of employee participation; and</li><li>globalisation and the law: the European Union and its implications for the traditional distinction between civil and common-law legal families.</li></ul>"
