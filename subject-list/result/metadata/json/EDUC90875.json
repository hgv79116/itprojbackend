    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces Teacher Candidates to research and practice that inform current approaches to language and literacy education in the primary school, positioning this within the discipline of subject English. The subject embraces the scope and sequence of teaching and learning in the primary years and the diverse nature of children\u2019s language and literacy experiences and practices in and out of school. It focuses on how language, literature and literacy form essential <strong>strands</strong> in the development of students\u2019 skills and knowledge around the <strong>modes</strong> of reading, viewing, writing, speaking and listening in the Victorian English Curriculum.</p>",
        "<p>Emphasis is placed on theoretical perspectives of early literacy acquisition and approaches that support the interrelationship between speaking and listening, reading and writing (language modes). In terms of the early years of school, the subject focuses on language development with particular attention to phonology, vocabulary and grammar related to early reading and writing; the importance of literature in language and literacy development (English curriculum strands); theories of reading acquisition that inform the teaching of reading; the development of writing; curriculum frameworks and assessment tools; strategies to support whole, small-group and individualised instruction in relation to print-based and multimodal texts to support literacy learning. Subject areas of focus that pertain to the middle and upper primary school include: investigation of the multiple forms of literacy and diverse forms of language awareness required for the comprehension, composition and production of complex texts central to English and other areas of the curriculum; reading and viewing strategies that assist all students to engage in comprehension; higher order thinking; critical analysis and inquiry around various written, visual, multimodal and technological texts; and the development of academic language proficiency in reading, writing, listening and speaking.</p>"
