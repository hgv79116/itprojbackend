    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides Master of Surgical Education students with an opportunity to integrate learning from the Graduate Certificate and Graduate Diploma courses. It is a capstone activity in which students develop a surgical curriculum relevant to their surgical education practice. This activity enables students to apply theoretical knowledge gained through earlier course content.</p>",
        "<p>The subject has two parts. First, the student conducts a needs assessment of stakeholders to establish the conditions and scope of the proposed curriculum. Second, students develop the curriculum considering all essential components. This must include program goals and outcomes, educational methods, target learners and their requisites, program content, faculty requirements, settings, equipment and other resources, assessment and an evaluation strategy. Depending on the nature of the curriculum, students may also include recruitment, selection, governance and other considerations.</p>",
        "<p>Students will be expected to demonstrate effective academic writing skills in the presentation of their curriculum and high level communication skills in an oral presentation. Students will also be expected to reflect on their advanced educational practice through reflective writing.</p>"
