    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject involves a series of regular meetings between the supervisor and students to discuss topics of contemporary or special interest in the field of Chinese studies. Topics will vary from year to year, depending on the interests of the cohort of students and their study needs. The subject is designed to offer students the opportunity to conduct independent research in their respective disciplines in areas of interest to them and present the findings in a scholarly manner. Students can choose topics of study that interest them, and students need to contact the subject coordinator in the first week of semester regarding a topic and appointing a supervisor. </p>"
