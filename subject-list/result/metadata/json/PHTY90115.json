    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will provide physiotherapy students with a general conceptual and evidence-based background in foundational biomedical sciences that underpin physiotherapy clinical practice and research. It will build on and integrate assumed areas of knowledge in the disciplines of anatomy, physiology and biomechanics to an understanding of the human body at the cellular, tissue, organ, and systems level. Systems and functions covered will include the anatomy and physiology of the integumentary, musculoskeletal, cardiorespiratory, neurological, metabolic, gastrointestinal and reproductive systems. Students will be expected to draw on research evidence to understand variations from typical structure and function and to apply an understanding of anatomy, physiology and biomechanics to their clinical reasoning related to health. In this subject, students will also reflect on their personal attitudes to and respond in an ethical manner to the privilege of learning anatomy from the study of human cadavers. They will expand on their personal skills for respectful collaboration in groupwork and will concisely and effectively communicate their understanding of the body\u2019s structures and function in their clinical reasoning for physiotherapy practice.</p>"
