        "<p>This is an elective subject in the Master of Public Health program that contributes to the Indigenous health stream and is a foundation subject for those interested in working with Indigenous peoples across the life course.  In this subject, students will be introduced to local and global concepts, frameworks and methods used by Indigenous populations to promote health equity and foster a global view of Indigenous peoples\u2019 health and wellbeing during the first 1000 days from conception to age 2. The First 1000 Days work in Indigenous communities is being developed and implemented across Australia, Indonesia and the Arctic Circle; providing a coordinated comprehensive intervention addressing the needs of Indigenous children and their families from pre conception to two years of age, thereby laying the foundation for their future health and well being. The subject will explore the First 1000 Days model and how to implement this model across different communities Australia wide, and with international partners.  Providing an international and national context for First 1000 Days, the subject will provide students with an opportunity to engage with cultural knowledge; programs targeting neonate, men and women of reproductive age and effective interventions for families and children; national and international data and evidence; novel longitudinal study design and practical strategies to implement First 1000 Days with families, organisations and across regions and countries. Also explored are impacts of this period of life across a lifetime \u2013 the impact of the First 1000 Days on the Last 1000 Days; healthy adolescence, adulthood and healthy aging. The subject is offered both on campus and on line to enable students to complete the subject remotely if required. </p>"
