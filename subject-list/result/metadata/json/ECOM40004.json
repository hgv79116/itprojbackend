    "overview": [
        "<p>Features of financial data require specific methods of analysis. Basic econometric tools are presented for the analysis of data such as stock exchange returns, exchange rates, bonds prices, etc. Applications of econometric models in finance include option pricing, extreme values and value at risk as well as financial assets portfolio selection. A special focus is put on modelling and forecasting of returns and volatility of financial assets. An up to date selection time series econometric models and methods is presented. The computer software used is R.</p>"
