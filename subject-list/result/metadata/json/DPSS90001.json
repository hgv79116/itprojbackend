        "<p>Students develop a working understanding of appropriate research methods, including practical experience in locating resources (local and global) for specific inquiries. Attention is given to the issues of research writing and editing as they apply to graduate research in the creative arts.</p>",
        "<p>This subject, if combined with the minor thesis option in Design Projects 3, forms a pathway to further graduate research studies.</p>"
