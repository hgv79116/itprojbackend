    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject examines the use of financial statements for the fundamental valuation of listed and non-listed entities. Fundamental analysis will be examined in detail and applied to valuation projects involving local and multinational companies. This subject is built around the use of residual earnings as a means of determining the intrinsic value of an entity using only accounting data. It explores the relation between the residual income valuation model, discounted cash flow valuation methods and dividend discount model. It also refers to EVA as a parallel valuation methodology. The subject will also consider forecasting firms' future performance and how it determines the firm\u2019s price/earnings and market to book ratios.</p>",
