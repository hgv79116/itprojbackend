    "overview": [
        "<p>The key aim of this subject is to prepare students for diverse, complex, and evolving physiotherapy careers/practices. This subject includes campus-based learning and two clinical placements: a Professional Selective placement and a Work Transition placement.</p>",
        "<p>Building upon previous DPT learning and the DPT graduate attributes, the subject provides opportunities to extend, deepen and apply knowledge, skills and attributes. Students will manage patients with complex needs in a range of settings through case-based learning, and through clinical placements in preparation for entry to practice. Emphasis will be placed on investigating, analysing and synthesising complex information, applying clinical reasoning, evidence-based practice and professional ethics, critiquing, debating and weighing priorities relating to the individual and their families. Additionally, there will be a focus on collaborative interprofessional practice, organisational and healthcare policies and priorities, and third party agencies to devise, implement and evaluate management plans that are responsive to the individual, systems of health and community care, and the environment. A professional selective placement will provide opportunities for students to choose a clinical, research or professional practice placement, in line with their early career preference.</p>",
        "<p>To further build and enhance transitional skills, knowledge and attributes necessary for practice as physiotherapists, students will be given opportunities to be reflective, critical and creative in addressing identified needs in their own professional practice and in a professional practice setting. Students will review Australian Physiotherapy Council standards to identify areas of need in their own professional knowledge and skills. In collaboration with clinical supervisors, students will address these identified need areas in their work transition clinical placements.</p>"
