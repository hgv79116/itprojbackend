        "<ul><li>The evolution and theory of the national and international copyright system</li><li>The material protected by copyright</li><li>The duration of protection</li><li>The rights granted by copyright</li><li>Infringement of copyright, including defences and available remedies</li><li>Ownership, licensing and assignment of copyright</li><li>Moral rights and their infringement</li><li>Copyright law in international perspective.</li></ul>",
