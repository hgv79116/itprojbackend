Syndicates work through the entire consulting process from receiving the client brief, negotiating the final terms of the consulting project, executing the negotiated consulting activities, and delivering and presenting a final report to the client. The consulting activities will require students to apply and integrate the knowledge, skills, and attributes acquired throughout the MBA program.</p>"
