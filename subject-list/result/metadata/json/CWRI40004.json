    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject explores the relationship between critical theory and creative writing. We read critical, philosophical and theoretical texts relating to issues of creativity and the creative process by seminal theorists such as Kristeva, Foucault, Cixous, and Derrida. We also read a selection of texts that blur the boundary between critical and creative writing, and the creative work of authors such as Duras, Calvino, Zadie Smith, and Barthelme to examine the way these texts might put theory into practice. The relation between critical schools of thought and students' own creative work will be investigated.</p>"
