    "overview": [
        "<p>The overall goal of this subject is to help students with no knowledge of Russian develop cultural and linguistic knowledge that allows them to feel comfortable thinking of themselves as users of Russian, in listening, reading, writing and speaking. It introduces students to cultural notions of time and space as they play themselves out in such topics and notions as talking about one\u2019s self and others (family and friends), living and working spaces, and referring to activities and events (in present-tense story-telling/dialogue). Comparisons to current Russian life and society build the foundation for cultural literacy and familiarity with the Russian-speaking world.</p>"
