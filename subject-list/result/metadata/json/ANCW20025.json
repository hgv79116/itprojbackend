        "<p>This course concentrates on the development of Rome from a small village into the center of a vast Empire, through the lens of artworks and archaeology. It examines a wide variety of themes (urbanism, public and private architecture, religion, economy) and sources of material evidence (pottery, coins etc.) to provide insight into the Roman World.</p>",
        "<p>Focus will be both on the overall structures, as well as on regional variation, and we will examine various groups within Roman society, from the upper levels to the common man. Specific emphasis will be placed on a number of key sites, both in Italy (Rome, Pompeii, Ostia) and in the Roman provinces. Furthermore, we will deal with the enduring importance (and misuse) of the Roman past in modern-day society.</p>",
