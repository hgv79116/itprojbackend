    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject teaches practical skills and applied knowledge for a range of careers in geoscience. It builds on an understanding of fundamental geological processes and systems and explores a range of topics including: resource exploration, responsible extraction of water and mineral resources, ore deposits, hazards, remediation, sustainability and infrastructure applications. The subject is based on four modules in sequence: 1. Mineral Futures, 2. Applied Geophysics, 3. Engineering Geoscience, 4. Environmental Geoscience and Water Resources. Each module includes background theory, topical discussion and practical classes, with a strong emphasis on case studies from past and present. One of the modules will include a one-day field trip which will focus on an ongoing remediation challenge in Victoria, and draws together the different aspects of the course. The course will bring together theoretical frameworks, active research and industry applications.</p>"
