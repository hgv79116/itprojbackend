    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject explores the influence of gender in (and on) international relations. In particular, this subject examines how gender is implicated in the construction of international relations, how this affects the behaviour of actors in international affairs, their positions vis-\u00e0-vis one another, and what this means for security, for the economy, and for global governance. Through an exploration of topics such as war and armed conflict, terrorism, development, the state and nationalism, globalization, foreign policy, and global institutions, this subject introduces students to connections between sex/gender relations and politics in the international arena. This subject is taught intensively over two weeks in February.</p>"
