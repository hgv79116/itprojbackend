    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject seeks to engage and excite students in an interactive series of \u2018lectorials' which examine the social, political, and cultural history of the many central and northern Italian cities which participated in the culture known as the Renaissance. With special case studies of Florence and Venice, major themes explored are: politics and urbanisation; art, architecture and patronage; religion and popular beliefs; the family and gender roles; luxury and consumption; humanism and education. Throughout students will be encouraged to reflect on the meaning and usefulness of the term \u2018Renaissance\u2019 as an historical construct. Students should complete this subject with a well-rounded picture of the Renaissance as a social and cultural context, which has left a profound impact upon the culture of the west in the succeeding centuries, including our own.</p>"
