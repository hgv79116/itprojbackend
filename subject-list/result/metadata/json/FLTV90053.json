Students will research and apply knowledge through creative reflection, analysis of production and post-production choices to complete their screen work in preparation for public exhibition. Self-reflection and evaluation of one's own and others' performance will enable recognition of alternative strategies and processes of improvement.</p>",
        "<p>Students will learn skills and approaches from master classes, individual tutorials and peer learning to become screen practitioners with a strong understanding and experience of industry-standard post-production techniques and expansive ways of thinking. </p>"
