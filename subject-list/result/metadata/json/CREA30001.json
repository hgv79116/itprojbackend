        "<p><strong>This subject has been designed and developed for online delivery and assessment only.</strong></p>",
        "<p>This <em>online</em> subject engages with the intersections of Indigenous design and creative practices with an emphasis on the strengths of Indigenous creative design practices in Australia.</p>",
        "<p>Informed by the assimilation period (1901-1973) in Australian history, students will examine historical and contemporary movements by First Nations artists to use art, craft and design to reinforce sovereignty and challenge the colonial project with reference to contemporary Indigenous scholarship, and focusing on resistance, refusal, authority, and agency.</p>",
        "<p>Students will develop their capacities to critically engage with Indigenous Knowledges, to inform their creative and collaborative practices, and to enact responsible culturally safe practices in the context of ongoing settler colonialism.</p>",
        "<p>In this <em>online</em> subject, digital synchronous (in real time) seminars and webinars are supported with guided and self-guided online learning modules and activities including discussions, archival research, and creative practice. </p>",
        "<p>Students will develop a creative project that enacts current strength-based approaches to change and transformation in First Peoples' communities. The creative project highlights the diversity, collaborative and empowering actions that can be taken working with and for communities that enrich learning student's experiences.</p>",
        "<p><em>This subject is developed and lead by Indigenous scholarship, pedagogies, and knowledges in creative and cultural practices.</em></p>",
        "<p><em>This subject is taught by First Nations people.</em></p>"
