        "<p>Students in this class will learn how to realise at their instrument a figured bass from the seventeenth or eighteenth century in a stylish and idiomatic fashion. We first learn how to read simple figures before progressing to more complex ones.</p>",
        "<p>Attention will be paid to correct voice-leading, melodic and harmonic improvisation, and differentiating between the predominant national styles.</p>",
        "<p>This subject will be of interest to any keyboardist or harmony-generating instrumentalist who wishes to refine their contrapuntal skills and knowledge as well as learn how to participate effectively in over two centuries of repertoire.</p>"
