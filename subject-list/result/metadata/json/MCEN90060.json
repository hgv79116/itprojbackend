    "overview": [
        "<p>Humankind faces global challenges related to economy, ecology and socio-policy, e.g. population growth, climate change, and unequal development.  Unsustainable consumption and production patterns have resulted in substantial economic and social costs and may endanger life on our planet. Engineers and scientists have developed methods and tools to evaluate and implement technological and societal processes to tackle the challenges of sustainability.  Therefore, this subject aims to develop a holistic view of engineering the entire life cycle of a product or service from raw material extraction, production, usage to disposal. </p>",
        "<p>This subject consists of four main modules 1) sustainable development and life cycle thinking; 2) life cycle analysis tools, 3) eco-design and cleaner production, and 4) closed-loop economy. This subject will engage students with the state-of-the-art research development and leading industrial practices in topics such as product life cycle management, life cycle assessment, sustainable manufacturing, circular economy etc. Guest speakers are also invited to provide broader examples from a global perspective.</p>"
