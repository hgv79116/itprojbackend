    "overview": [
        "<p>This course covers a diverse range of topics related to the operation and design of helicopters. Civilian and military operators are increasingly using helicopters for a variety of applications. In certain roles helicopters offer numerous advantages over fixed-wing aircraft by meeting the growing needs of multi-dimensional flight including hover. The unique roles and missions of helicopters introduce several design issues and challenges for the design engineer to address.</p>",
        "<p>Helicopter design is governed by the role, missions, payload, mission systems (internal or external) and the flight profile. This requires an understanding of helicopter operations; of mission systems technologies to provide the mission capability; and of aerodynamics to provide the flight performance.</p>",
        "<p>Through the subject, students will be able to transform helicopter system operational requirements to design requirements; and be able to apply helicopter conceptual design stages. As an exercise, the students will develop a conceptual design of a helicopter, based on the proposed role of the helicopter and mission requirements.</p>"
