    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides students with the opportunity to design and conduct, under supervision, an independent biomedical research project. Specific research projects will depend on the availability of appropriate supervisors and resources. This subject will provide students with skills and experience conducting research in an area of human health and disease across the breadth of paediatric disciplines. Projects may include laboratory, clinical or public health research skills. Students will take responsibility for analysis, data interpretation and dissemination of the research findings via oral and written presentations. The course year starts in February and ends in November and is only available full time. This subject is designed to complement the accompanying coursework subject <a href=\"https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/current/PAED40002\" title=\"PAED40002\">PAED40002</a>.<br/><br/></p>"
