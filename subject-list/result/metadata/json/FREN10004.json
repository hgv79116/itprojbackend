    "overview": [
        "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This subject offers students an introduction to the study of language and culture in the French Studies discipline. The subject is designed to equip students who have little or no previous study of the French language with the skills necessary to become independent language learners, and to develop awareness and understanding of French-speaking cultures throughout the world. While developing mastery of the basic grammatical structures of the language, students will begin interpreting and discussing authentic documents in French, including short written texts, for example poems and proverbs, and audiovisual material such as songs and advertisements.</p>",
        "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Class work and assessment will focus on the development of reading and writing skills via the interpretation of authentic texts, and also on oral communication skills, including listening comprehension, pronunciation, and discussion of the texts studied. Students will undertake a group project on an aspect of French-speaking cultures. Throughout the semester, students will develop increasing autonomy in their study of the French language and French-speaking cultures throughout the world.</p>"
