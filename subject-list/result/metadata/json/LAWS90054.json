        "<p>The aim is to overview the current UK international tax system, and its historical development. Focus will be on corporate taxation, but with some background on individuals (trust, partnerships etc will be mentioned only briefly). This will cover issues such as: residence and source definitions; relief from double taxation (both unilateral and bilateral), CFC legislation, transfer pricing and thin cap, worldwide debt cap, the impact of tax treaties, dividend exemption and PE exemption, and some discussion of the Diverted Profits Tax. Key themes will include the impact of European Union law, and the UK\u2019s policy of tax competition. The subject will give students an overview and general understanding of the UK corporate tax system for both inbound and outbound investments.</p>",
