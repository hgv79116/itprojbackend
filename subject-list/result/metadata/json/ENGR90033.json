        "<p>This subject involves students undertaking professional work experience with a Host Organisation, generally at the Host Organisation\u2019s premises. Students will work under the supervision of both an academic mentor and an external supervisor at the Host Organisation.</p>",
        "<p>By completing their internship as part of this subject, students will receive support in navigating their placement, guidance on maximising their learning from the experiences they gain and training in how to use these experiences when seeking employment.</p>",
        "<p>This subject uses structured reflection to help students develop the professional skills and competencies required by engineers and IT professionals. Each student is allocated an academic mentor to assist them in their development and support their well-being.</p>",
