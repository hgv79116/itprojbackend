    "overview": [
        "<p>Coverage of the rapidly expanding field of neuropsychological rehabilitation is provided in this subject. The curriculum covers the nature of recovery following focal and diffuse brain injury from neurological, cognitive and psychosocial viewpoints, as well as frameworks for developing appropriate neuropsychological interventions for rehabilitation. Commonly encountered disorders such as stroke and brain injury will be discussed in the context of their cognitive, emotional, and social effects, including neuropsychiatric comorbidities. Approaches to the assessment and management of cognitive and behavioural disorders will be surveyed, with an emphasis on designing and implementing cognitive and behavioural interventions that are patient-centred and culturally responsive. During the semester students may be required to make observations regarding a patient's recovery, practice how to design and implement an intervention, or provide psychoeducation and feedback to patients and families, as they explore the various roles of clinical neuropsychologists in rehabilitation settings.</p>"
