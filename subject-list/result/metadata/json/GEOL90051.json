    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will teach how to interpret structure and stratigraphy on seismic data and in the field and the interactions between structure and stratigraphy during basin development. The interpretations will be used to assess hydrocarbon and gas-storage potential in the basins. The subject involves one week in the lab and one week in the field along the Otway coast at Port Campbell and Apollo Bay. The subject will examine the 2D and 3D geometries of extension, inversion, compression, salt diapirism and strike-slip deformation and the sedimentation/erosion and stratigraphic patterns that develop. In the field, we will mainly examine the deformation and sedimentation that occurs during extension and inversion and determine the basin environment of deposition through geological time.</p>"
