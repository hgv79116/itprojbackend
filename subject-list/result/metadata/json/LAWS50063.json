    "overview": [
        "<p>Competition law concerns the preservation and promotion of competition in Australia. As a critical component of micro-economic policy, this field of law is underpinned by economic theory and is primarily (though not exclusively) driven by economic goals. This subject focuses on the regulation of anti-competitive practices under Part IV of the <em>Competition and Consumer Act 2010</em> (Cth). In particular, it examines the regulation of mergers and acquisitions, the misuse of market power, and horizontal and vertical restraints.</p>",
        "<p>This subject also addresses the policies and practices involved in enforcing competition law and considers contemporary global competition law and policy issues and some international and comparative perspectives. This subject not only ensures that students have an advanced understanding of the technical aspects of this legal specialty, it also enables them to critically analyse the law from both policy and practical perspectives and introduces them to an interdisciplinary approach in the study of law, through the introduction and application of economic concepts and theories in a legal context.</p>"
