    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is designed to provide optometrists with the opportunity to extend their capabilities in contact lens practice. Optometrists will explore contemporary evidence-based information regarding common in-practice contact lens issues including: use of clinical grading scales; contact lens discomfort; microbiology and infection associated with contact lens wear; and the impact of new materials, lens designs and solutions. Optometrists will also extend their knowledge in advanced contact lens fitting such as: toric rigid lens fitting; contact lenses for keratoconus; orthokeratology and the fitting of contact lenses after corneal surgery.</p>"
