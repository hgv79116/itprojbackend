    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is designed to provide students with an understanding of the fundamental characteristics of companies and the legal principles that regulate the establishment, management and dissolution of companies in Australia. The subject is organised around 10 core concepts:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Introduction to companies and the regulatory scheme;</li><li>Incorporation and its effects;</li><li>Managing companies;</li><li>Duties and liabilities of directors and officers \u2013 framework of duties, duty to act in good faith and duty to act for a proper purpose;</li><li>Duties and liabilities of directors and officers \u2013 duty of care;</li><li>Duties and liabilities of directors and officers \u2013 loyalty;</li><li>Shareholder actions;</li><li>Corporate liability;</li><li>Share capital; and</li><li>Introduction to corporate insolvency.</li></ul>",
        "<p>Particular emphasis is placed in this subject on the management and control of companies. This necessarily involves an exploration of two key questions:</p>",
        "<ol><li>What are the legal responsibilities of those persons - directors and other officers - entrusted with the oversight and management of companies?</li><li>What can (in particular, minority or non-controlling) shareholders do to protect their interests in a company?</li></ol>",
        "<p>These questions are derived from the overwhelming concern of scholarship in the field of company law, which is to investigate the nature and ramifications of the relationships between those who manage or control companies, those who have supplied capital to companies and those who otherwise contract with companies.</p>"
