    "overview": [
        "<p>Since 11 September 2001, there has been a global trend towards enacting new laws and adopting new measures against terrorism, reflected in developments on the national, regional and international levels. Many such counter-terrorism laws and measures have raised questions about the nature of human rights law, and the extent of its adaptability in face of security imperatives. Others have revealed clear human rights violations and exposed the fragility of respect for the rule of law. Responses by the courts and international mechanisms have had a role to play in redressing this reality in various ways, but they too have met challenges. This subject addresses the international law framework within which responses to terrorism, and to counter-terrorism, unfold. It considers human rights law in the context of other relevant areas of international law and practice, such as humanitarian law and the law on peace and security. It examines legal questions not in abstract but by reference to examples from practice, and in light of the many real-life challenges to giving effect to the law in the security context today. It provides a stock-taking review and questions the human rights implications of global counter-terrorism practice.</p>",
