        "<p>Managing diversity is a strategic approach towards HRM. It is about utilising human resources efficiently and effectively by identifying significant differences in the workforce and labour markets, and exploring the potential advantages of workforce diversity. This subject will examine the key issues of managing diversity from both a theoretical and empirical perspective. The focus of the subject is anti-discrimination in all aspects of employment. This will be examined by a consideration of the discrimination and fairness, access and legitimacy, and learning and effectiveness paradigms.</p>"
