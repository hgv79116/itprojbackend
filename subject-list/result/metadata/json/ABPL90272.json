        "<p>The majority of sustainable practices are pursued within the \u2018mechanistic\u2019 or eco-efficient orientation of sustainability where measurement and reduction is the primary focus. This subject turns the sole focus of \u2018doing less harm\u2019 on its head, and proposes a radical new direction for sustainable development \u2013 one that is focused on fostering socio-ecological connection and thrive-ability across communities.</p>",
        "<p>The subject will include a series of lectures exploring ideas of Indigenous knowledge systems, biophilia and biomimicry, ecological design, regenerative development, placemaking and contributive design. Students will take part in a series of seminars and site visits (documented through bi-weekly reflections), and have the opportunity to apply their learnings to an existing project in Melbourne</p>"
