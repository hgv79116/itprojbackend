    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject concentrates on developments in art and culture in the twenty-first century. It is oriented by the proposition that the displacement and disparagement of postmodernism over the past decades has resulted in an upsurge of new artistic modes, concerns, and aspirations.</p>",
        "<p>Students will explore the language and methods for critically describing and interpreting works of art, using examples from the contemporary era. Through study of select works of art, students examine historical, social, cultural and political contexts. This subject develops from Critical and Theoretical Studies 1\u20133, introducing more advanced modes of critical interpretation in the visual arts together with a focus upon collaborative skills.</p>",
        "<p>Critical and Theoretical Studies 4 includes an embedded program in academic literacy skills in analysis, discussion, essay writing, research and information retrieval, and is designed to complement accompanying studio-based programs.</p>"
