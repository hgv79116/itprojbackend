It examines whether there is a distinct EU approach to regional integration and queries whether this may be transposed in other contexts. We introduce the core concepts of EU law and policy, and thoroughly review key sectors in European law, with a particular focus on their impact in other parts of the world including the Asia Pacific. </p>",
