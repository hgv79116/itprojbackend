    "overview": [
        "<p>Since the turn of the last century, Latin America in general and the Andean region in particular have witnessed a pronounced escalation of investment in extractive industries. Driven in large part by historically high commodity prices and rising Chinese demand, national governments have sought to use oil and mineral rents to finance novel programs of economic redistribution. While generating significant socio-economic benefits, these projects have also contributed to the intensification of environmental conflicts, particularly around water. In recent years, Chile has been home to more than 35 mining-related conflicts, most of them on indigenous territories over water resources.</p>",
        "<p>This subject takes an interdisciplinary approach to understanding these conflicts, with a particular focus on the Atacama Desert in northern Chile. It asks comparative questions about the relationships between large-scale mining and indigenous displacement, conflicts over culturally distinct understandings of territory, relationality, and well-being, the legacies of water privatization, the increasingly asymmetrical relations between corporations headquartered in the Global North and extractive frontiers in the Global South, and the effects of climate change on water-related struggles throughout the region. Throughout, we explore similarities and differences with both past and present mining struggles in Australia.</p>",
        "<p>The Atacama Desert offers a particularly privileged location in which to investigate these dynamics on the ground. One of Chile\u2019s main tourist attractions, its rich deposits of copper, lithium and other minerals, its water scarcity, and its long history of indigenous settlements in tension with colonial enclaves, have made it a fascinating microcosm of the regional, national, and global dynamics explored throughout the subject. As a University of Melbourne Overseas subject (UMOS) this subject will take place on site in collaboration with the Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile. Whilst based in Chile, the subject will involve field trips to relevant sites.</p>"
