    "overview": [
        "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This subject develops the concepts of vectors, matrices and the methods of linear algebra and introduces students to differentiation and integration of functions of two variables. Students will be exposed to methods of mathematical proof. Little of the material here has been seen at school and the level of understanding required represents an advance on previous studies. Underlying concepts developed in lectures will be reinforced in computer laboratory classes.</p>",
        "<p class=\"SSPBodyText\">Topics covered include systems of linear equations, matrices and determinants, vector geometry, lines and planes, vector spaces, subspaces, linear independence, bases, dimension, inner products, linear transformations, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, complex eigenvalues and exponentials as well as techniques of proof, partial derivatives, chain rule for partial derivatives, directional derivatives, tangent planes, extrema for functions of several variables and double integrals.</p>",
