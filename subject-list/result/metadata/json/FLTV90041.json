    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides students with a direct opportunity to integrate theory into practice through an industry attachment experience. Students will learn through observation and practice gaining real experience working in an industry setting that underpins and is relevant to their producing practice and/or career trajectory.</p>",
        "<p>Students will be responsible for identifying a suitable work placement prior to the study period, with support from the Subject Coordinator. The placement can be taken within Australia or overseas and should be between 80 - 100 hours (or between 8 - 10 weeks). Any overseas or interstate travel is at the student's own expense.</p>",
        "<p>The educational and practice/research aims of the subject are the same for all students, but the type of experience, content and ultimate structure of the subject will be determined by the nature of the interface the student has planned through preparatory tutorials. Each student will work with their supervisor who will support them through planning, preparation, the internship and the writing-up phase following the placement.</p>",
        "<p>The structure of the subject will involve:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Meetings, in person or virtually, with the industry partner</li><li>Semester one pre-placement seminars. All seminars will occur at the beginning of the first semester to prepare the students for their attachment </li><li>Occasional academic supervision before, during and after the placement to be determined in consultation with the subject coordinator, and participation in seminars as required</li><li>An intensive, or longer/less intensive placement within the screen industry</li><li>Documentation of this placement through journal writing and archiving of relevant materials, culminating in a final reflective/critical report.</li></ul>",
        "<p> </p>",
