    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides a broad introduction to the processes and skills associated with the construction of buildings and introduces some of the techniques used in managing the construction process. The characteristics and nature of the construction industry are presented as well as an overview of the historical evolution of the built environment. The various roles and responsibilities in the construction industry are explored in the context of the building development process. Other critical aspects of the building development process are also presented, including the materials and equipment used in contemporary building projects, regulations, contracts, procurement methods, occupational health and safety, and project management. Emphasis is placed on the importance of organisation, problem solving, teamwork and communication in the construction industry, reinforced by the collaborative approach to subject activities and assessment. Emerging industry trends are explored, including environmental sustainability, technological innovation and the use of information technology. Construction site visits and industry professionals provide a real-world demonstration of the theories and principles covered.</p>",
        "<p>This subject will provide a lens on the University\u2019s Joining Melbourne Modules. These will be completed in parallel to the subject - unless already successfully completed. It will also support the Discovery goals for commencing students by introducing emerging concepts and research in the discipline area; ways to connect with the larger University community including peers, teachers and student groups; and awareness of academic expectations, and of wellbeing support offered at the University of Melbourne.</p>"
