        "<p>Accounting Research Report 2 is the second subject designed to develop a student\u2019s research skills during their coursework training. The objective is to give students an opportunity to use what they have learned during the first year of coursework and develop a research project based on a sound theoretical framework. The subject will also require students to collect data to test their theoretical framework and develop a manuscript that can be workshopped and submitted for publication in a leading accounting research journal. The Director of the Doctoral Program in Accounting or their nominee must approve the topic and in discussion with the student, will assign a supervisor. A one\u2010page summary of the Research Proposal should be submitted to Director of the Doctoral Program and the Supervisor/s of the project. This is due by the end of May. This is not an assessment piece but rather for discussion with the Director of the Program, potential supervisor of the project and the student. The Research Report must be submitted by the end of the November University Examination Period.</p>"
