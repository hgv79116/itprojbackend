        "<p>This Capstone subject draws together students\u2019 undergraduate experiences in psychology by emphasising links between the science and practice of psychology in contemporary life.</p>",
        "<p>In the lecture series, students engage with topics relating to current applications of psychological research and practice such as the ethical practice of psychology and the measurement of attitudes, behaviour, and behavioural change as related to contemporary issues such as climate change, indigenous cultural respect, drug addiction, and psychological health and wellbeing.</p>",
        "<p>In the research seminars, students work in small groups to design and conduct a research project under the supervision of an academic researcher.</p>",
        "<p>Together, the lecture and research streams prepare students for further studies in psychology or to enter the workplace having developed skills in applying psychological knowledge, conducting research, working collaboratively, and communicating effectively about psychological theories and findings. Students\u2019 achievements are celebrated in a final poster presentation evening at which the research conducted by groups over the semester is presented to peers and academic staff.</p>"
