        "<p><strong>Students are responsible for identifying a suitable work placement themselves prior to the start of semester in consultation with the subject coordinator. </strong></p>",
        "<p><br/>Students enrolled in this subject will complete a minimum 10 day or equivalent (paid/unpaid) placement with an external organisation that is related to the student\u2019s chosen major within the Bachelor of Design or Bachelor of Environments. The placement should draw on specific discipline skills associated with the course of enrolment and give students opportunity to interact with professionals in different areas of work that they might be interested in. Students will be supervised by a member of staff at the university in collaboration with a designated party at the host organisation. They will work across a range of tasks relevant to the organisation's objectives and will develop and complete a specific project in discussion with the host organisation and the Subject Coordinator.<br/>The placement is supplemented by compulsory pre- and post-placement seminars designed to introduce skills for developing, identifying and articulating employability skills and attributes and linking them to employer requirements. Seminars may also include consideration of career planning and professional skills while integrating academic learning, employability skills and attributes and an improved knowledge of organisations, workplace culture and career pathways.<br/>On completion of the subject, students will have completed and reported on an industry-related project in a workplace and reflected on the working lives of different professional disciplines. They will have enhanced employability skills including communication, interpersonal, analytical and problem-solving, organisational and time-management, and an understanding of career planning and professional development.</p>",
        "<p><strong>NOTE: </strong> Students may provisionally enrol via the Student Portal. Provisional enrolment does not guarantee your space in this subject. Students may be asked to choose another subject if they have NOT been able to secure a suitable placement before the start of semester.</p>"
