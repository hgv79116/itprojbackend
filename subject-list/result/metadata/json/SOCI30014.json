    "overview": [
        "<p>Australia is a nation that has been profoundly shaped by European settler colonisation, the White Australia Policy, and the fiction of terra nullius. This subject examines race and racism in contemporary Australia. It introduces theoretical tools from sociology to assist us in understanding how race and racism operate in Australia, who benefits from racism, and why racism is difficult to change. It looks at situations faced by First Nations people in their fight for sovereignty and justice, anti-migrant racisms, and how race, a social construction, is constantly shifting. The subject also explores anti-racism efforts, why most are ineffective, and what might be more effective.</p>"
