    "overview": [
        "<p>The demand for project management skills and capabilities in design professions continues to grow in parallel to an increase in organisations undertaking and embracing project-based work. As a result, project management skills and competencies can be seen as a competitive advantage in design-based industries <br/>and creative practice. An understanding of project management principles is particularly important for early career design professionals given the challenges that they may be exposed to. These may include managing stakeholder relationships, understanding and managing changing project requirements, needing to adopt different project leadership styles, and responding to fast paced industry-based challenges. </p>",
        "<p><br/>This subject offers students both a theoretical and practical understanding of project management principles as they apply in the context of design-based professions and project-based work in the industry. Students will become familiar with the fundamentals of project management through a series of lectures and tutorials with accompanying readings, industry case studies, and collaborative activities. The subject will develop students\u2019 understanding of the nature of projects in the context of their respective future professions and creative endeavours and equip them with the insights and tools they need to conceptualise, manage, communicate and apply a range of project management-based tools and frameworks. In this way, this subject will help students develop work readiness for project-based work</p>"
