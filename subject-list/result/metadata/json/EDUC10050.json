    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will lead students to increase their understanding of various perspectives on knowing and learning while developing practical approaches to learning and its enhancement. This will be achieved through the exploration of a range of theoretical perspectives combined with practical application. Perspectives covered include behaviourist, constructivist and socio-cultural theories, practice-based and critical approaches, as well as Indigenous perspectives on knowing and learning. Practical application will involve regular supported volunteer tutoring in community-based learning support programs.</p>"
