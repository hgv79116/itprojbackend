        "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This subject introduces the essential features of decision-making techniques encountered in operations research, management, industry, business and economics. It shows how to construct formal mathematical models for practical decision-making as encountered in two-person games, multi-objective optimisation problems, stochastic decision problems, group decision and social choice, and decision-making under uncertainty. It shows students further uses of linear programming and introduces dynamic programming techniques.</p>"
