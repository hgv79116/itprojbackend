        "<p>The subject builds on the content of Interactive Composition 1, 2 and 3. It further examines the skills required for individual composers to develop their craft in collaboration, event presentation and interactive music making.</p>",

Workshop is taught as a seminar and provides the opportunity for group discussion of issues related to interactive composition and a forum for the workshop of new works.</p>",
        "<p>During the subject students will be required to engage in whole group discussion and to present complete and ongoing interactive compositions.</p>"
