    "overview": [
        "<p>Offshore wind geotechnical engineering aims to provide basic knowledge and current design practice of offshore wind foundations in the Australian and global context. This subject is of particular interest to students intending to establish a career in the fast growing offshore renewable energy industry. The subject will provide an overview of current offshore renewable energy technologies, characteristics of common offshore sediments and geohazards. It will cover foundation design of offshore wind structures, including loadings on foundations and design considerations, offshore site characterization techniques and soil-structure interaction. Students will also develop their technical and professional ability to work and communicate effectively in diverse offshore engineering teams through a group design portfolio of offshore wind foundation design. <br/> <br/>The subject will cover topics such as offshore renewable energy systems, characteristics of seabed sediments and geohazards, loads on offshore wind foundation, offshore site characterization, and offshore wind foundation design.</p>"
