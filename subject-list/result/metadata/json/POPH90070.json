    "overview": [
        "<p>This is a public health and clinical subject for health professionals working or hoping to work in the area of sexual and reproductive health (SRH). The subject is focused on the clinical and practical aspects of providing sexual and reproductive health clinical services within the Australian health care setting. It introduces clinicians to the concept that the design and management of these clinical services is crucial in maximising the public health of their community and explores this theme through case examples of those most at risk of poor SRH. This includes CALD communities, young people, LGBTQI, Indigenous Australians and those affected by sexual violence amongst others. It specifically explores how to set up cervical cancer screening, STI screening and HIV screening and equips practitioners with requisite knowledge and skills in sensitive communication in order to provide accessible services. In addition, it invites critique on policies that support such practices and highlights the importance of establishing such policies in one\u2019s own workplace. The subject is divided into 5 themes:</p>",
        "<ol><li>Clinical SRH services and their impact on public health of communities</li><li>At risk groups and priorities in clinical SRH services</li><li>Screening: cervical cancer, STIs and BBVs</li><li>Fertility control: contraceptive choices and services, unplanned pregnancies and access to services</li><li>SRH Policies in the clinical workplace</li></ol>",
        "<p>Students who are <strong>Division 1 nurses</strong> and have <strong>current registration in Australia</strong> and who <strong>complete this subject successfully</strong> are able to undertake additional training to become accredited as nurse cervical screening providers and accredited HIV and Hep C test advisors.</p>",
        "<p>This clinical accreditation is not part of the subject but can only be undertaken when this subject has been completed. This additional training is run by Melbourne Sexual Health Centre, Alfred Health, not the University of Melbourne.</p>"
