        "<p>What makes a city cool? Is Melbourne really one of the most liveable cities in the world\u2014and for whom? How do different populations (artists, students, migrants from elsewhere in Australia, young and old, people of different genders) experience the city? And who has the capacity to shape the future of our cities? To explore these key questions, this subject gives students the opportunity to undertake ethnographic research in Melbourne. It aims to familiarize students with key issues in urban anthropology that reflect the dynamics of cities across the world. Students will explore processes of place-making, urban migration, spatial segregation, and urban governance and conflict.</p>",
        "<p>Working together with peers and teachers, they will conduct research by observing and participating in urban events, mapping spatial and social relationships, conducting unstructured and semi-structured interviews, digital ethnography, and more. Each year, classes will focus on a shared set of themes, sometimes in collaboration with research partners. Overall, this subject will help students to develop important job-relevant skills, prepare for more advanced study in social sciences, and get to know fellow classmates through collaborative research.</p>"
