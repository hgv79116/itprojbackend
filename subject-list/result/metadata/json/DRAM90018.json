    "overview": [
        "<p>In a format that includes a two-week mini-intensive and six follow-up seminars, this subject focuses closely on the development of a project idea that builds and demonstrates the creative vision that will underpin the student\u2019s work for their final year and beyond.</p>",
        "<p>The intensive takes place through lectures, visiting speakers, and collaborative practical workshops. The subject will introduce the student to theoretical and practical concepts of project realization, implementation methodologies, strategic planning, networking, budgeting, documentation, evaluation, report making, pitching and marketing. It will investigate the issues and demands of being an artist in the broader community.</p>",
        "<p>It will also explore projects that align with the student\u2019s proposed research question, identifying and refining their research practice trajectory for the year. Prior to the subject commencing the students will complete an online investigation of a series of questions that will begin a digital work journal that will be brought to the two-week mini-intensive.</p>",
        "<p>The emphasis of the subject will be the entrepreneurial aspect of a director\u2019s craft. The subject will culminate in the presentation of a project pitch, a detailed written project management plan, a short critical essay on the research question underlying that project and a set of marketing materials.</p>"
