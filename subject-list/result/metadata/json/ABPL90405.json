    "overview": [
        "<p>Cities are responsible for more than 70% of energy use and associated greenhouse gas emissions. The operation of buildings alone represents around 40% of energy use in many developed economies. Reducing energy use and transitioning towards zero greenhouse emissions in the built environment is therefore critical to sustain the Earth\u2019s ecosystems and the general environmental equilibrium of the planet. This is further recognised by the UN sustainability goals, namely<em> Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities</em>. With a growing world population, most of which going to live in cities, addressing this current and upcoming challenge is paramount.</p>",
        "<p><strong>The aim of this subject is to equip students with the skills and knowledge required to analyse, quantify, visualise and improve the energy performance of buildings, neighbourhoods and cities, at different scales of the built environment, towards zero greenhouse gas emissions.</strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject is designed to capitalise on the multi-disciplinary nature of participants. As such, it uses active discussions, interactive problem solving, peer review and group work, among other teaching and learning activities. In addition, the major assessment task is designed to allow for a significant amount of flexibility as you will be able to determine the focus of your own assignment. You will also be able to vote to determine subject content towards the end of the semester.</p>"
