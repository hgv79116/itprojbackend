        "<p>The impacts of climate change will not be felt by changes in our average temperature, but by changes to the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. But why is that? And what does it mean for Australia?</p>",
        "<p>These are the questions you will explore in this subject.</p>",
        "<p>You will examine the circulation of our atmosphere and learn the connection between weather systems like thunderstorms and global patterns such as the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation phenomenon.</p>",
        "<p>You will learn the difference between global climate variability and human-induced climate change and understand how both play a role in the extreme weather experienced around the world today.</p>",
        "<p>You will also look to the future and gain an appreciation for how climate models project what the world will look like in 20, 50 and 200 years. Through case studies, guest lectures, field experiments, and the latest climate research, you will explore the biggest challenge of our time.</p>"
