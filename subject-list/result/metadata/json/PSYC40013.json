        "<p>This Capstone subject draws together students\u2019 experiences in the Graduate Diploma in Psychology by emphasising links between the science and practice of psychology in contemporary life.</p>",
        "<p>The lectures engage students in considering topics related to current applications of psychological research and practice such as the ethical practice of psychology and the measurement of attitudes, behaviour, and behavioural change as related to contemporary issues such as climate change, indigenous cultural respect, drug addiction, and psychological health and wellbeing.</p>",
        "<p>The research seminars engage students in small groups to design and conduct a research project under the supervision of an academic researcher. </p>",
        "<p>The graduate attributes seminars engage students in interactive activities to develop their skills in reflective practice and oral presentation.</p>",
        "<p>Together, the three components of the subject prepare students for further studies in psychology or to enter the workplace having developed skills in applying psychological knowledge, conducting research, working collaboratively, and communicating effectively about psychological theories and findings.</p>",
        "<p>Students present their research findings in individual oral presentations to their peers and academic staff at the end of semester. Students reflect on the development of their psychological knowledge and skills, articulating their achievements in a Graduate Attributes Portfolio.</p>"
