        "<p>This subject develops a foundation for pursuing research in the area of secure cyberphysical systems. Issues pertaining to the modelling, detection, and mitigation of attacks in cyberphysical networks are investigated from a system theoretic point of view. The coverage of fundamental material is complemented by exposure to realistic scenarios within the context of small projects.<br/><br/><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT</strong></p>",
        "<p>Coverage of selected topics from the following:</p>",
        "<p>Review of necessary tools from linear algebra, systems theory, graph theory, optimisation theory, statistics, and detection theory, particularly norms, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, fundamental linear spaces and their properties, system of simultaneous linear equations, least square solutions, numerical linear algebra, observability and controllability in dynamical systems, algebraic graph theory, Kuhn-Karush-Tucker conditions, and hypothesis testing.</p>",
        "<p>Developing a unified framework for modelling potential attacks and vulnerabilities in cyberphysical systems such as replay attacks, denial of service attacks, eavesdropping (man-in-the-middle attacks), bias-injection attacks, etc.</p>",
        "<p>Detecting attacks in cyberphysical systems under different information availability assumptions; introducing security indices to characterise vulnerabilities of cyberphysical systems; mitigating the attacks after detection through ameliorating their impact on the cyberphysical system.</p>"
