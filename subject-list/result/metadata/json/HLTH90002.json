        "<p>This subject explores the range of approaches useful for researching health and human services practice. Here \u201cpractice\u201d is defined broadly to encompass work at policy and organizational levels as well as directly with individuals, groups, and communities. This subject will take students through the process of research design which will include looking at different methodologies \u2013 from descriptive and exploratory studies to establishing the effectiveness of \u2018what we do\u2019. It will explore approaches to undertaking community-based studies as well as review the benefits of, and theoretical approaches used in accessing existing databases. The current organisational emphasis on evidence-based and evidence-informed practice will be considered along with the skill and knowledge base required to access and evaluate research evidence. This subject will promote a theoretical and skill base of practice research that will support practitioners to engage in reflective and evidence informed practice.</p>"
