        "<p>Light pollution is one of the fastest growing challenges in modern society but is rarely recognised or incorporated into urban development and city planning. Light pollution is rapidly erasing our view of the stars, negatively impacting astronomical heritage and astrophysics research, as well as damaging the health and behaviour of humans and wildlife, with further consequences on tourism and economics. The challenge of slowing the growth of artificial light and reducing light pollution for the benefit of society and the environment falls primarily on urban planning and landscape design through engineering solutions and policy implementation.</p>",
        "<p><br/>Students in this 2-week summer intensive, trans-disciplinary subject will be introduced to each of these topics by global experts in their respective fields and apply what they have learned in their degree programs to seek solutions through practical sessions and fieldwork with real-world results.</p>",
        "<p><br/>Central questions include: How does light pollution impact astronomy, ecology, human health, and society as a whole? What are the main sources and contributors to this problem? How is our understanding of the stars impacted by the growth of light pollution? How are artificial satellites contributing to this issue? What impact does light pollution have on Indigenous health and cultures? How can we address these concerns through the study of landscape architecture, city planning, and urban design? What are the current success stories in this space that can direct these solutions?</p>",
        "<p><br/><em><strong>Students will spend two days on the University of Melbourne Parkville or Southbank campuses (approx. 1.00pm to 9.00pm) to survey lighting, ecology, and star visibility. This will serve as the basis of a group project to develop a strategic plan to addresses concerns and find solutions to light pollution on these campuses.</strong></em></p>"
