    "overview": [
        "<p>The Australian healthcare system is facing unprecedented challenges, including rising costs, changing population demographics, increasing burden of chronic diseases, and growing public demand for better access, quality, and outcomes of care. These challenges require a fundamental transformation of the healthcare system, from fragmented and episodic to an integrated and patient-centered model of care that delivers value for money and improves population health.</p>",
        "<p>To achieve this transformation, it is crucial to understand the drivers for health system reform and the emerging policy and program directions in Australia as we work toward a system design that can achieve change and better outcomes for society.</p>",
        "<p>This subject will provide health professionals with a comprehensive and up-to-date understanding of the current drivers and future trends in health system transformation, including embedding equitable co design practices and measuring outcomes in areas such as health systems governance, financing, value based care, workforce planning, innovation, primary and integrated care, digital health, environmental sustainability, and delivery of inclusive care for priority populations.</p>",
        "<p>Through a mix of lectures, case studies, and group discussions, health professionals, managers and policy-makers will explore the latest research, policies, and practices in health system reform and transformation, and develop critical skills in health policy and systems analysis.</p>",
        "<p> </p>",
        "<p>Overall, this subject will provide health professionals with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed to become effective health system leaders and change agents who can drive innovation, improve performance, and enhance the health and wellbeing of individuals and populations. Health professionals will have the opportunity to engage with and learn from a diverse range of health sector leaders, experts and peers, focused on the Australian health system, but with applicability to international settings. </p>",
        "<p>This subject is designed for a range of experienced health professionals with an interest in health system reform and transformation, including: </p>",
        "<p>- Public health practitioners </p>",
        "<p>- Health policy analysts </p>",
