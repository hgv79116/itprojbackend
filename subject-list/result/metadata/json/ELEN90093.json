    "overview": [
        "<p>Students in this subject will be introduced to computer architectures, microprocessors, microcontrollers, operating systems, compilers and software design. The proposed course will cover a broad range of topics necessary to make students knowledgeable in the art of microprocessor design including advanced concepts such as in line and out of order execution and execution unit resource optimisation. Students in this course will learn to design execution units, arithmetic logic units, memory hierarchies and learn strategies for cache sizing. As part of this, students will become proficient in microcode and instruction set design, multi-processor and multi core theory and design, including new design methodologies such as chiplet design. Upon completion, students will be familiar with the specification and synthesis of microprocessor systems using high level generator languages such as Chisel and Scala. The course will also introduce students to compiler and linker design, enhancements to instruction sets, c-language and the theory of operating systems.</p>"
