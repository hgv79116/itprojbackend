    "overview": [
        "<p>Political, social and constitutional upheavals are currently in full swing in Latin America. What happens in Latin America produces flow-on effects in all regions of the globe. This subject offers a survey of the different models of democracy currently \u2018competing\u2019 in the region, and a consideration of how those models translate into different \u2018models\u2019 of constitutionalism. The subject offers an analysis of the current constitutional debate in Latin America, contextualising that debate within the history of constitutionalism in the region over the last two hundred years. The subject will relate the contemporary constitutional debate to global and regional debates about models of democracy and the impact of globalisation in constitutional law and practice. The subject will also focus on the role played by the Inter-American Human Rights System in both the constitutionalism and models of democracy debates.</p>",
