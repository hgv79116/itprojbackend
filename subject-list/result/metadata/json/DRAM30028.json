        "<p>Dance classes expand the students\u2019 physical vocabulary and ability to learn choreography. Technical classes support production work while continuing to build the strength and adaptability of the actor\u2019s instrument. Through training tasks and exercises, students develop advanced acting, vocal and physical skills.</p>"
