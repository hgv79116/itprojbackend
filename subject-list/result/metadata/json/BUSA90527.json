        "<p>Product Managers are the all-rounders in a technology team. Product managers understand customer and business needs, and drive the conception of digital products that meet those needs. They are the owners and drivers of what digital product is build, and partners of the software engineers that design, build, and deliver the products. They work throughout the digital product lifecycle, from the beginning steps of writing product requirements documents, through the tradeoffs and prioritisation during development, to the delivery of the digital products to users, and its subsequent improvement through iteration. Along the way, they are the communicators and evangelists that work up, across and inside the organisation to ensure information flows effectively.</p>",

The subject will give students an introductory grounding in ten critical competency areas of product management, and bring together practical examples, contemporary thinking, and also masterclasses from industry.   </p>"
