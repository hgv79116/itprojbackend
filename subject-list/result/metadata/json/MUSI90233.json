        "<p>Students will undertake this subject to develop sound working knowledge, and isolate and cultivate the skills, necessary for performing opera repertoire with confidence from either the baroque/classical periods, or the romantic/twentieth-century periods, depending on the cycle of repertoire selection for the course. This will include the development of:</p>",
        "<p>Either:<br/>- Strategies for singers to achieve confident interactive voice, lyric diction and body work for stage productions;</p>",
        "<p>Or:<br/>- Strategies for repetiteurs to work confidently between keyboard parts and full orchestral scores in a spontaneous rehearsal context, and to negotiate with confidence complex ensemble interactions and dynamics in the rehearsal room.</p>",
        "<p>To achieve these goals, students will work in group contexts to consolidate and develop:<br/>- Confident skills in vocal delivery and acting with appropriate stylistic approaches<br/>- Confident skills in the interactions between singing, speech, lyric diction and text appropriate to the demands of either baroque/classical, or romantic/twentieth-century operatic works</p>"
