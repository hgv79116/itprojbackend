        "<p>This subject is the capstone for the Environmental System major in the Bachelor of Science. It addresses the major steps in environmental engineering design using the systems approach and builds on knowledge gained in subjects including Engineering Mathematics, Fluid Mechanics and Earth Processes for Engineering and assumes a familiarity with concepts of sustainability and engineering systems.</p>",
        "<p>Engineering systems are often highly complex, especially environmental systems which are often not well understood. Engineering design of models of such systems pose significant challenges since the models typically involve a large number of decision variables (and therefore a large number of potential solutions), multiple competing objectives and are often subject to various constraints.</p>",
        "<p>Factors that influence the design process include logical problem formulation which facilitates a systematic approach to problem solution, analysis of the model to identify optimal design solutions and investigation of model performance. The final decision-making process can be further complicated by the fact that different stakeholders may have different or conflicting preferences.</p>"
