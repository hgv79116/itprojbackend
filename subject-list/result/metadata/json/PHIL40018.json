    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will explore selected topics in contemporary epistemology. We will focus on a specific topic or set of related topics in epistemology, and examine contemporary research on this topic. Sometimes a historical dimension may enter the subject where it is important to ground the topic in the work of an important historical figure (e.g. Descartes, Moore, Sellars, Wittgenstein). Specific topics may vary from year to year. They may include such topics as certainty, scepticism, relativism, the nature of epistemic warrant or justification, the epistemic role of perception, externalist, contextualist and naturalist accounts of justification and/or knowledge and the nature of <em>a priori</em> knowledge.</p>"
