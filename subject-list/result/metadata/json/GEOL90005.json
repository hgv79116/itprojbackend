    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will investigate, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the fundamental physical and chemical processes governing groundwater flow and composition, including aquifer properties, regional geology, hydrology and water-rock interactions. Field and laboratory methods such as well tests, water analysis in the field and in the laboratory and data analysis are demonstrated and used to characterise hydraulic conductivity and mixing, water types and potential contamination. A one-week field excursion to the Newer Volcanic Province and the Limestone Coast will draw together many of these concepts and will emphasise surface and groundwater connectivity and groundwater supported ecosystems.</p>",
        "<p>This subject will have a 1-week intensive field trip that will be delivered in the week prior to the start of Semester 1 (pre-teaching period) and 6 weeks of teaching during weeks 1-6 of Semester 1.   </p>"
