        "<p>This course will focus on (1) the fundamental knowledge to understand transport systems from the perspective of an engineer and planner, and on (2) how new technologies can be integrated with existing transport services to improve accessibility and sustainability in transport systems. Key skills will be attained in the areas of data collection and processing, analysis, and evaluation. </p>"
