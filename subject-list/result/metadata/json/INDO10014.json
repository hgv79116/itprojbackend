    "overview": [
        "<p>In an increasingly globalised world it is impossible to imagine any state including Indonesia being completely disengaged from the rest of the world. Indonesia's constant global engagement is evidence of its geopolitical importance on the international stage. Indonesia is a unitary state built out of culturally and historically diverse components, and its diversity is the potential for dialogue with other nation-states. In this subject, students will examine the interaction dynamics between Indonesia and the world from a range of perspectives such as language and culture, politics, education, commerce, and entertainment. There are two main themes that will be discussed in a complementary manner namely nationalism and internationalism. Indonesia's colonial past and its post-colonial experience, as well as the symbols and the pragmatic social-political processes for building national cohesion and international relations, will be explored in order to comprehend the extent of mutual influences between Indonesia and the world. This subject is conducted in Indonesian.</p>"
