    "overview": [
        "<p><strong>AIMS</strong><br/><br/>This subject introduces students to the special requirements necessary for the successful design of high rise buildings. Elements of high rise building design considered in the subject are structural floor, framing and foundation systems, wind loading including wind tunnel testing and earthquake loading, analysis techniques including computer-aided analysis, vertical movements and second order effects, facade design, construction methods, sustainability concepts and a review of case study buildings.<br/><br/>The subject builds on fundamental structural engineering knowledge and when learnt together with other structural engineering electives will provide students who successfully complete the subjects a well-rounded knowledge of a range of structural engineering design skills. Students who complete this subject may find work in a structural engineering consultancy or as a site engineer and work under the supervision of a chartered professional engineer on high rise building designs or design variations.<br/><br/><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT</strong><br/><br/>Introduction to high-rise design; introduction to finite element analysis; loads and design criteria for tall buildings; gravity load resisting; structural systems; gravity loads; lateral load resisting structural system; SpaceGass modelling; wind loading and analysis; earthquake induced loading; distribution of lateral loads to structural elements; coupled core systems and outriggers; theoretical treatment for column beam frames; architectural aspects and sustainability concepts; extreme loading effects; foundations of tall buildings; and, construction methods. Skills acquired from the above topics will be integrated and applied to the assignment which consists of a detailed analysis of a typical high rise building.</p>"
