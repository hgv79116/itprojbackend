    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides an introduction to the basic principles, analysis, and design of distributed systems and game theory within an engineering context, encompassing fundamental concepts, analytical tools, and algorithms. It focuses on multi-person decision-making on distributed systems and game-theoretic approaches to resource allocation. Both static, distributed, and convex optimisation and (non)linear dynamical systems are studied. The concepts and methods discussed are illustrated in multiple application areas including Internet of Things (IoT), smart grid and power systems, cyber-security, and communication networks.</p>",
        "<p>The concepts taught in this subject will allow for a better understanding of distributed systems and provide much needed expertise for analysis and design of such systems using game theory.</p>",
