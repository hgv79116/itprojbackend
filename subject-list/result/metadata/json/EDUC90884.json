        "<p><em>EDUC90884 Integrating Clinical Practice (Prim)</em> builds on the learning developed in <em>EDUC90885 Introduction to Clinical Practice (Prim)</em>to further explore and consolidate Teacher Candidates\u2019 knowledge and application of assessment, pedagogy and instructional approaches related to clinical practice. It aims to further equip Teacher Candidates with the knowledge and skills necessary to assess student learning at the class and individual levels, and then to justify the selection of strategies appropriate to students\u2019 learning needs.</p>",
        "<p>Students will become familiar with planning frameworks that promote inclusive classroom and consider pedagogical approaches and strategies designed to meet students\u2019 learning needs. Teacher Candidates will connect and engage with students, developing their knowledge of verbal and non-verbal communication to support student understanding. Teacher Candidates will gain enhanced understandings of assessment techniques that underpin the articulation of learning progressions and methods that provide grounds for making reliable judgements about student learning will support the planning and implementation of inclusive classroom practices. Teacher Candidates will develop methods for collecting and maintaining accurate and reliable data on student achievement and strategies for reporting to students and parents/carers.</p>",
        "<p>Teacher Candidates will articulate learning progressions using student behaviours; develop methods for making reliable judgements about student learning; analyse student evidence to determine the next steps in learning and to evaluate progress; identify interventions and their associated research; select interventions to match the student and their context; and reflect on the implementation of interventions. The theme of the content presented in this core subject is \u2018making judgements and adjustments\u2019.</p>"
