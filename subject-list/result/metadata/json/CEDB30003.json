        "<p>In this subject students will gain a detailed understanding of the molecular, biochemical and cellular events that regulate the development of specialised cells, tissues and organs during embryonic development. In particular, cell signalling pathways that regulate embryonic induction, tissue interactions and pattern formation, and expression of regulatory genes. A particular focus is the experimental strategies and techniques that are used to identify molecular and cellular mechanisms of development.</p>"
