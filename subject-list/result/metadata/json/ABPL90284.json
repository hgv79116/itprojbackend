        "<p>This subject provides an introduction to architectural design taught in a series of three vignettes, each encompassing a different methodology for operating as a designer and a problem solver. The vignettes are structurally independent from one another, but build their complexity, scale and the amount of architectural tools required to complete them providing not only a diversity of tools, but also a survey of pedagogies. The sequence will instil a strong understanding of the foundations of excellent design practice.</p>",
