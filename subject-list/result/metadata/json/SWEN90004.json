    "overview": [
        "<p><strong>AIMS</strong><br/><br/>Mathematical modelling is important for understanding and engineering many facets of complex systems. The aim of this subject is for students to understand the range and use of mathematical theories and notations in the analysis of discrete systems, how to abstract the key aspects of a problem into a model to handle complexity, and how models can be employed to verify large-scale complex software systems.<br/><br/><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT</strong><br/><br/>Topics covered will be selected from: deterministic and stochastic modelling; dynamical systems; cellular automata; agent-based modelling; complex networks; simulation and analysis of complex systems; concurrent systems modelling, analysis and implementation; process algebra; temporal logic and model checking.</p>"
