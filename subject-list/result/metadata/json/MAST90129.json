    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces the fundamental mathematical models used to study infectious diseases at both the epidemiological and within-host scale. The emphasis is on: 1) how models are developed, from conceptualisation through to implementation in software; and 2) how to apply models to questions of epidemiological, public health and biological importance. Statistical techniques for the model-based analysis of relevant data resources will be introduced.</p>",

        "In addition to learning specific skills that will assist students in their future careers in science, they will have the opportunity to develop generic skills that will assist them in any future career path. In particular:\n\n- modelling skills: the ability to abstract and generalise from observations of a complex system, providing an alternative perspective on the problem\n\n- numerical and computer simulation skills: the ability to design computer programs to solve models and test hypotheses\n\n- time-management skills: the ability to meet regular deadlines while balancing competing commitments."
