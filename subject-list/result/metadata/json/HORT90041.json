    "overview": [
        "<p>Environmental stresses such as drought, extreme heat and severe wind events are increasing in urban environments. This subject aims to teach students how and why urban trees are vulnerable to such stresses through an understanding of fundamental tree biology. Mechanisms used by trees to adapt to stress will be investigated from a cellular to a whole tree level. This subject will be delivered through participation in a five-day intensive teaching period including lectures, tutorials and practical activities. Further study and completion of assessments are required in the nine weeks following the intensive teaching period </p>"
