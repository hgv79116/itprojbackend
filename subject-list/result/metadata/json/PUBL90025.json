    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject gives students hands-on experience of publishing through the Publishing program\u2019s teaching press, Grattan Street Press, and teaches reflective learning techniques to consolidate the development of project management skills. Working under the supervision of a staff member, a student will produce two substantive publishing projects, equivalent to 6500 words of written assessment. The projects will be part of two larger team publishing projects led by staff and based in the teaching press. Students will also complete a journal or essay analysing their experience of publishing project management in a team environment (2500 words), and contribute to a team presentation of project outcomes (equivalent to 1000 words).</p>"
