    "overview": [
        "<p>Outer space, high seas, the deep seabed and Antarctica are areas governed by international law using the same set of legal principles centred around international management, non-appropriation, equitable use and peaceful purposes. The importance of these international areas and their resources has increased exponentially over the past 30 years due to globalisation and the need for these resources. New technologies, increasing demands for new resources, climate change and exotic tourism, driven by a tripling of the global economy over the next 30 years, mean that their importance will again increase dramatically. Management of these areas and their valuable resources is a rapidly developing area of international law that will affect many different areas of commerce and the law. This subject provides a unique opportunity to learn from two international lawyers with practical experience in the field.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>What are international areas, what is their importance and what are future trends in their use?</li><li>The historical development of regulations governing the use of international areas and their resources, such as fishing, oil and gas extraction, pollution and access to orbits</li><li>Law governing major international areas and their natural resources, including:<br/><ul><li>Polar</li><li>Outer space</li><li>High seas</li><li>Deep seabed</li><li>Atmosphere</li></ul></li><li>Current issues and developments, in particular:<br/><ul><li>Management of resources in the deep seabed, continental shelves, polar regions and celestial bodies</li><li>Equitable access to outer space orbits, especially geostationary orbits</li><li>Challenges of tourism in the deep sea, outer space and Antarctica</li><li>Environmental impacts of human activities (polar melting; space debris; ocean fertilisation; marine pollution and dumping)</li><li>The right to protest at sea in connection with the use of natural resources</li><li>New and emerging uses of these areas (e.g. geo-engineering and the use of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture).</li></ul></li></ul>"
