        "<p>This subject is delivered in two consecutive parts. Whilst these have separate subject codes, they are considered to be a single continuing subject of 75 credit points. At the end of the first part, students will receive a CNT (Continuing \u2013 ongoing) grade. At the completion of the second part, students will receive an overall result for the subject.</p>",
        "<p>Information provided here applies to both parts of the subject:</p>",
        "<p><a href=\"#\">POPH40005</a> <a href=\"#\">POPH40006</a></p>",
        "<p><br/>The subject provides the student with an opportunity to design and conduct an original research project under the supervision of an academic staff member in the Melbourne School of Population and Global Health from February to November. The student will be introduced to methods to search and summarise the published research literature relevant to the topic of their honours project. They will be trained in the formulation of a research question and the elements of research design. The research project may involve quantitative or qualitative research, ethical, legal or policy analysis, or health program evaluation. As well as written and oral presentation of the research, in most cases it is also expected that the work will culminate in an original research publication.</p>"
