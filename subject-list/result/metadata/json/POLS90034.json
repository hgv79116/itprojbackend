        "<p>This subject examines how policy is made at both the domestic and global levels. We will explore key actors in policy making, the factors and sources of information that they consider, the obstacles they confront, and the strategies and techniques they bring to bear to move policy forward. We will examine how governments and international organizations set agendas, formulate policy, engage stakeholders, and implement and evaluate policy. As well as a practical focus on government policymakers, this subject will also expose students to the roles and influence of non-governmental organizations, corporate actors, and other sub-national stakeholders in domestic and global policy making.</p>",
        "<p>We will explore issues in practical policy making through a series of case studies. This subject is unique in that it features senior guest lecturers from government, civil society, and the private sector, with past guests including foreign affairs ministers, senior diplomats, and more. Case studies and specific issues covered each year may include, among others:</p>",
        "<ul><li>The evolution of economic diplomacy, including international efforts to manage the global economy through the G20</li><li>Global policy coordination and the domestic determinants of policy to address climate change and biodiversity protection</li><li>Multilateral arms control efforts, including those relating to nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament</li><li>The role of sub-national actors in global policy making, including nongovernmental organizations, corporations, the news media, and others.</li></ul>"
