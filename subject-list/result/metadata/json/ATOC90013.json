        "<p>The aim of this unit is to describe the design of global atmospheric models as they are used in Numerical Weather Prediction, seasonal prediction and climate simulation. The unit aims to provide a basic understanding of all aspects of global atmospheric modelling. It will describe modelling techniques required to apply the fundamental equations that govern atmospheric flow in the settings of a modern General Circulation Model.</p>"
