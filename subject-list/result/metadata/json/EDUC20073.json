        "<p>This subject will explore the bi-directional relationship between health and learning across the life span, acknowledging that this relationship is influential in every aspect of our lives. Through examining current issues in health and education, the subject will provide insights to the social determinants that contribute to these issues, the perspectives of different stakeholders as well as the current challenges in addressing these issues for the individual and wider community.  </p>",
        "<p>Through the application of innovative intervention design approaches, students will design an evidence-informed intervention to address a contemporary health or education issue using an approach which considers the perspectives of different stakeholders involved in the issue. In addition, students will also understand how to evaluate the intervention\u2019s success.</p>"
