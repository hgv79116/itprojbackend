Students will develop skills in creative and conceptual collaboration and will explore methods for undertaking collaborative practice in order to develop a practical understanding of interdisciplinary collaboration.</p>",
        "<p>In developing these skills, students will be working and interacting with others involved in the conceptualising of graphic work for print, screen, outdoor or other media, collaborating with other designers, directors, cinematographers and key creatives to build teams and explore the essential connections between their practices.</p>"
