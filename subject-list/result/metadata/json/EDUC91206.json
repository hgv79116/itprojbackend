    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces Interns to the theory and pedagogies of language and literacy education, emphasising the increasing complexity of literacy in secondary schools. Recognising the interrelationship between literacy and learning, Interns are supported to identify both the language and literacy needs of their students, and the language and literacy demands of their learning areas. This subject references the Australian/Victorian Curricula and Frameworks.</p>",
        "<p>Interns will be introduced to a range of teaching strategies across the language modes - speaking, listening, reading, viewing, writing - and supported to select best practice pedagogy and assessment to develop their classroom practice.</p>",
        "<p>Embedded throughout this subject is the Clinical Teaching Model, which will support Interns to select and integrate teaching strategies and resources, including ICT, and to assess and provide feedback to students to meet their learning needs.</p>",
        "<p>The assessment tasks in this subject will support Interns to apply their understanding of contemporary theories and pedagogies of language and literacy to the language and literacy demands of their learning areas to develop, structure and sequence learning programs and use assessment and feedback to support student learning.</p>"
