    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces the fundamentals of spatial data analytics and geoprocessing. By using hands-on exercises with real-life geological datasets, the students learn how to handle data in relational databases, query data with simple SQL statements, cleaning, formatting and exporting geospatial datasets and geo-processing the data in GIS software packages. At the start the subject will focus on looking at the basics of database structures, data analytics and data querying. In the second part of the course the students will create GIS projects, plot spatial data, start analysing and geoprocessing geospatial data, creating interpolated heatmaps, rasterizing point clouds and combining and standardizing disperse datasets. We will also practice data extraction, such as how-to geo-reference a map in Google Earth and in GIS, extract data locations from a geo-referenced image and how to create a final GIS project, including legend and map. Finally, the course concludes with bringing all the data together and creating a final GIS project visualizing all pre-analysed data.</p>"
