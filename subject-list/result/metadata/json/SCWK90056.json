    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces a number of approaches to <em>program planning</em> and <em>evaluation</em>, and highlights both practical aspects of the program design and evaluation process, and more conceptual or theoretical aspects. The subject focuses on macro social work interventions at the program/ organisational level. It includes how to develop new human service programs and/or how to modify existing programs to address identified needs. It further examines how to evaluate programs to assess if a program is meeting the identified needs and achieving intended outcomes. Each week of the subject focuses on a specific stage of the program planning/design process from needs assessment, program design, budgeting, implementation through to evaluation.  As part of the subject assessment students will design a new human service program and also develop an evaluation plan for the program idea they have developed.</p>"
