    "overview": [
        "<p>In this subject students will be placed in an organisation which either analyses or formulates and implements policy in relation to international affairs. The range of organisations relevant to the internship is broad: international organisations, government departments, non-government organisations (including church-based aid agencies), academic and analytical think tanks. Interns will work under the supervision and guidance of a senior manager within these organisations. Students will be provided with advice by the Subject Coordinator on potential organisations to contact, but will also be required to use their own networks; their choice will then need to be ratified by the Subject Coordinator. Students will carry out research or analytical exercises of relevance to the organisation\u2019s international affairs-related work. Students will also observe the structure, culture and policy environment of the organisation and develop advanced analytical, research and report-writing skills; as well as negotiating and interpersonal skills. Students completing this course should expect to acquire significant insight into the complexities of international relations and associated policy making and management activities. During the internship an academic supervisor will advise them.</p>",
        "<p>If primary research is carried out during the internship, ethics approval is the responsibility of the host organisation.</p>"
