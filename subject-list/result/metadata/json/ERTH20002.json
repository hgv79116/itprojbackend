    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject examines anthropogenic perturbations in a range of environmental systems by determining changes to physical-chemical processes at the Earth\u2019s surface. Case studies are presented discussing issues such as groundwater drawdown from mining, ocean acidification from rising CO2 in the atmosphere, acid mine drainage and the risks and benefits of geological CO2 storage and of unconventional gas production. The underlying processes are illustrated and the impacts are both qualitatively and quantitatively assessed, for example, by using a mass balance approach, reconstructing the groundwater flow field or by deriving imposed changes to chemical reactions and reaction rates at the Earth surface. Time scales of current perturbations are examined in the context of environmental changes in the geological past.</p>"
