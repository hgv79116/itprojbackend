        "<p>This is a collection-based subject, focused on objects made between 1250 and 1750 and now in Melbourne collections. Each year, one local collection will be chosen for students to carry out primary research around collection objects. Material from relevant temporary exhibitions will also be incorporated where appropriate. The aim is to explore the theoretical and practical issues around the study of early-modern art; and to work towards producing new and original research on Melbourne-area works.</p>"
