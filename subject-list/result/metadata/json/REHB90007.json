    "overview": [
        "<p>This wholly online subject explores core theory and frameworks that underpin Musculoskeletal Rehabilitation in specific and diverse practice contexts. The subject will provide students with the opportunity to gain knowledge and develop skills that enable them to implement musculoskeletal assessment and management models in their practice context. Biomedical and biopsychosocial paradigms are examined; alongside an emphasis on contemporary structure and function and developing movement and task analysis skills. With consideration of relevant services, systems &amp; policies, these are applied to the clinical reasoning, decisions and evaluation of patient-centred musculoskeletal rehabilitation plans. There is an opportunity to select <strong>modules</strong> to allow flexibility for students to choose areas of musculoskeletal rehabilitation practice that best match their disciplinary interests or work context. These include hospital, community and sports &amp; exercise contexts. Similarly, students will be given options to tailor case-examinations and assessment tasks according to their specific area of practice.</p>",
        "<p><br/></p>",
        "<p>Following an introduction to musculoskeletal rehabilitation, movement analysis and exercise therapy, students can choose <strong><em>two from three modules</em></strong> that best meets their learning needs. In the relevant area of practice, each of these modules explores service models, strategic policies and practice standards that inform therapeutic interventions and features of comprehensive care in priority areas. These modules are:</p>",
        "<p><br/></p>",
        "<ol><li><strong>Hospital based musculoskeletal rehabilitation</strong></li><li><strong>Musculoskeletal rehabilitation in the community </strong></li><li><strong>Musculoskeletal rehabilitation for Sports &amp; Exercise</strong></li></ol>",
        "<p><br/></p>",
        "<p>Students will develop the skills to identify literature and clinical guidelines related to case management. It is envisaged that study within these modules will underpin case selection for the integration and application of evidence informed musculoskeletal rehabilitation practice, culminating in a case-presentation assessment task. On completion of this subject, students will demonstrate skills in developing and justifying an evidence-informed rehabilitation program for an individual with a neuro-musculoskeletal condition. There is structured opportunity for peer review of the rehabilitation program design, critical review of the context and reflection on practice.</p>"
