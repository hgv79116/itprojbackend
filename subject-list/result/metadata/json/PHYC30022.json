        "<p>This subject will introduce topics in Theoretical Physics, including:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Classical Field Theory: Action Principles and Noether\u2019s Theorem. Electrodynamics and wave equations from action principle. Applications selected from: waves in media, dispersion relations, solitons, Kramers-Kronig relations, the Optical Theorem.</li><li>Fluid Mechanics: Euler\u2019s equation, the continuity equation and the Navier-Stokes equation. Rotational and irrotational flows. Turbulence and Reynolds\u2019 numbers, and the onset of chaos. The Rayleigh-Taylor and other instabilities. Shock waves. The Kutta-Joukowski theorem and aerodynamics.</li><li>Symmetry: Crystallography, point groups and space groups. Quasicrystals. Vibrational modes of molecules and molecular electronic structure. Crystal field theory. The uses of SU(2) in quantum mechanics. The SO(4) solution of the hydrogen atom. Relativistic invariance: the Lorentz and Poincare groups.</li></ul>"
