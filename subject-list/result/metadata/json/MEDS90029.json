    "overview": [
        "<p>This two-part subject will allow students to develop and investigate a research question of relevance to surgical education. Participants will design and implement a research project drawing on research methodologies from education. Participants will need to consider and where appropriate seek human research ethics approval for their study.</p>",
        "<p>Traditional approaches to research projects will be followed including a critical review of relevant literature, writing researchable question/s, designing appropriate methodologies, analysing and reporting results, discussion including framing results in existing literature and drawing conclusion. Participants are also expected to demonstrate effective academic writing skills and present their project in an oral presentation.</p>",
        "<p>The overall aims of this subject are:</p>",
        "<ul><li>To deepen understanding of educational research methodology</li><li>To provide participants with an opportunity to conduct a research project in surgical education</li><li>To apply skills relevant for educational research</li></ul>"
