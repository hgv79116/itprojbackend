        "<p>CSIRO\u2019s Data61 digital research network describes blockchain technology as \u2018a revolutionary new approach to database management\u2019 that will prompt \u2018significant changes in existing Australian industries\u2019. Yet, despite significant investments of time and money by institutions around the world, we still lack robust proof of social or commercial benefit. Several years have passed since Bitcoin\u2019s \u2018Genesis Block\u2019 was mined, but that foundational use case\u2014digital cash without traditional intermediaries\u2014has not challenged the legacy payments infrastructure. Where blockchain-based assets are used as monetary instruments rather than investments, those transactions are atypical in subject-matter and frequency.</p>",
        "<p>All of this begs the question: if the goal of blockchain technology is to eliminate \u2018trusted third parties\u2019, why is that something to aspire to? Is the answer to that question commercial or political? And, most importantly, is it <em>correct</em>? The aim of this subject is to answer these questions, and to do so by situating cryptoassets in their global context\u2014as a matter of law, economics, politics and society.</p>"
