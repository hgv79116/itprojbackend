        "<p>Protecting the integrity of sport from doping and match-fixing has become a high profile cause, especially with growing concern over links to illegal gambling, money laundering (estimated at US$130 billion through sports betting) and organised crime. Yet perhaps an even greater threat to the integrity and reputation of sport is to be found away from the fields of play. Corruption in the board rooms and administrative offices of the bodies charged with bringing leadership and good governance to world sport threatens to undermine the willingness of national governments, broadcasters and sponsors to provide essential support and serves to disillusion athletes and fans.</p>",
        "<p><em>Corruption in International Sport </em>explores the murky realm of \u2018institutional or off-field corruption\u2019. By comparison with anti-doping and anti-match fixing, off-field corruption has been lightly regulated and controlled. This subject will investigate the major scandals and the legal and regulatory responses of both international sports bodies and national governmental authorities. With an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the international legal order applying to corruption in sport, students will be in a position to contribute to debate and regulatory development concerning this important issue.</p>",
        "<p>The lecturers share extensive knowledge in sports integrity and will bring international and national perspectives to the subject matter.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Nature and incidence of corruption in international sport with particular attention to the allocation of event hosting rights, commercial dealings, governance and links between doping, match-fixing and sports betting</li><li>The role and nature of international and national laws against bribery and corruption including jurisdictional issues and the realtionship between such laws</li><li>Anti-corruption standards and measures in international sports bodies</li><li>Regulatory measures of sports bodies to address corruption in the awarding of event hosting and other commercial rights</li><li>Ethical standards in the governance of sports bodies including protocols for transparency</li><li>The mechanisms of investigation and prosecution of corrupt activity including information-sharing between sports and relevant government authorities</li><li>The role of independent, private monitoring agencies and pressure groups such as the news media and Transparency International.</li></ul>"
