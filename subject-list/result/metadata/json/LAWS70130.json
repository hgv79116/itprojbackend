        "<p>The Australian states and territories levy various taxes on businesses and individuals, including payroll tax, land tax, duties on transfers and acquisitions, leases and workers\u2019 compensation levies. Interpreting and complying with this multitude of taxes, only some of which are harmonised across state borders, poses significant challenges for Australian businesses and state revenue agencies alike. Many jurisdictions are enacting more comprehensive anti-avoidance and business entity rules in key state taxes - for example, those applying to trusts or corporate groups - and there is increasing litigation on state taxes in courts around the country. This subject will provide tax professionals with an advanced knowledge of the structure and practical operation of state taxes and duties in a commercial context, taking account of the most recent trends and developments in this field.</p>",
