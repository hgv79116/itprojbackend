    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject surveys some methodological approaches that are relevant to analysis of urban systems and urban planning processes.  Students will be equipped to analyse both primary and secondary data, understand and apply essential principles of both qualitative and quantitative methods, and identify the context for their appropriate use. Students will be trained to critically assess shortcomings of data sources and methods, and consider the impact this has on the conclusions drawn.  Overall, the subject facilitates the development of skills and knowledge regarding the use, collection, analysis, and representation of information.  This will be utilized in future subjects and practice as planners.<strong> </strong>It is divided into three parts:</p>",
        "<p>Part 1.  Universal Concepts in Research</p>",
        "<p>Part 2.  Quantitative Research</p>",
        "<p>Part 3.  Qualitative Research</p>"
