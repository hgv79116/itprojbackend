    "overview": [
        "<p>Underlying the undergraduate design course is the development of both design thinking and dexterity with tools and techniques. The focus of this design subject will be on generating design ideas, translating them into architectural forms, spaces, materials and programs. Students will learn how to refine architecture through consideration of spatial organisation, environmental context and structural necessity. Students will also learn how to communicate comprehensive architectural propositions through 2D- and 3D-modelling (physical and digital), visual and written media and oral presentations.<br/><br/>This is the capstone subject for the Architecture major in the Bachelor of Design, integrating previous coursework in the major. <br/><br/>The focus of this subject is architecture that deals with design issues at the urban scale. The site and accompanying projects deal with a development of up to 100,000m2, or a combination of sites at this scale. The project will see the design within the context of an urban morphology and will examine and explore the consequences of individual projects to their surrounding context. The project will engage with historical, theoretical, structural, and environmental ideas relevant to the specific project through the lectures and various design exercises.<br/><br/>In this capstone subject a high degree of design resolution and comprehensive presentation of the project is expected. The completed project and design journal forms the centrepiece of an undergraduate portfolio.</p>"
