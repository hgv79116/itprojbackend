    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject describes how technologies enabling the sequencing of complete genomes have transformed biological research in the past decades. Bioinformatics provides the tools to analyse these massive data connecting nucleic acids to the structures and functions of life. The advanced topics will review current knowledge on genomics and transcriptomics and describe the databases used to gather this information.</p>",
        "<p>The course will provide to non-specialised life-scientists the core concepts in genomics and bioinformatics. It will describe how to utilise public databases to retrieve biological information and develop a critical understanding of the methods used to generate them. This subject will explore how genomes are sequenced and annotated, and how connections are drawn between the different levels of molecular organisation to build a systems understanding of complex biological processes.</p>"
