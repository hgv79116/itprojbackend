    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject builds on the principles of immunology acquired by students in the pre-requisite subject MIIM30002 and provides a more detailed study of specific aspects of immunology. These include clinical and emerging areas in immunology such as: immune mechanisms that protect against pathogens and the implications for vaccine development and global health; immune system control and the diseases that may arise when that control is compromised; applications of immunology in organ transplantation; and immunotherapies to treat diseases of the immune system and cancers.</p>",
        "<p>This subject is delivered by specialist research-based and clinical immunologists, who are experts in these areas of immunology. They will discuss the experimental basis of our knowledge of immunology, how laboratory-based research has been translated into clinical practice, and future directions for immunology research and clinical application.</p>"
