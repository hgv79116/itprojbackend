        "<p>Modern applied statistics combines the power of modern computing and theoretical statistics. This subject considers the computational techniques required for the practical implementation of statistical theory, and includes Bayes and Monte-Carlo methods. The subject focuses on the application of these techniques to generalised linear models, which are commonly used in the analysis of categorical data.</p>"
