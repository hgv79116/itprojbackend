        "<p>Students will receive tuition in their area of practical study. Vocal and instrumental students will consolidate their technique and informed decisions concerning style and interpretation in an individually designed program of recital repertoire. Formative feedback in individual and group settings will be provided across the semester.</p>",
        "<p>In order to contextualise their education within the best practices of local, national and international standards, students are expected to work competently and productively both alone and in groups. The subject involves participation in individual lessons, instrument/voice classes, concert class and/or assigned ensemble activities. In order to ensure the highest level of performance preparation, 100% attendance is expected.</p>",
