        "<p><strong>AIMS</strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject involves students learning the integrated process between design and construction by developing a proposal for a design &amp; build project. An objective of the project is to help students explore the close relationship between design, constructability and construction. Students will develop a simplified design for an infrastructure project that includes a range of civil works such as basements, pavement and earthworks, foundations, drainage, level crossing removal projects, bridge construction and cranage, and then propose solutions for construction that may require iteration of the design. The proposed solution would also address OH&amp;S, environmental, and social sustainability issues inherent in areas such waste minimisation, noise and dust control in a project environmental management plan.</p>"
