    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces students to the diverse world of microbiology and the roles that microorganisms play in all aspects of agriculture, including animal, plant and soil science. The basic structure and biology of microorganisms will be covered, with a focus on bacteria, viruses and fungi. Aspects of molecular biology and genetics will also be introduced. The role that microorganisms play within the environment, in particular relating to plant, animal and soil health, will also be considered. The use of microorganisms in food and beverage production is also discussed, as well as how bioinformatics can be utilised in agricultural microbiology.</p>"
