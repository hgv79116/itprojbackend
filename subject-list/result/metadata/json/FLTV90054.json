    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides students an opportunity to actively combine theory and practice through undertaking an industry placement and attending a relevant film festival and/or screen culture event. Students will learn through observation and participation, gaining real life experience of their chosen industry through hands-on work practice, screen market participation and exhibition. </p>",
        "<p>Either the placement and/or festival/cultural experience may be taken locally or internationally. Students will reflect on the combined experience of both their industry placement and cultural/festival experience through the writing of a reflective journal and an oral presentation.</p>",
        "<p>Students, in consultation with the Subject Coordinator, will be responsible for identifying relevant and mutually sympathetic work placement and festival/cultural experiences - representing combined creative and industrial sympathies, and underpinning their emerging practice and/or career trajectory.</p>",
        "<p>A suitable work placement and festival/cultural experience will be determined in the initial stages of the study period and can be undertaken at any time across the study period. The placement and cultural experience/festival can be taken locally or abroad. </p>",
        "<p>The industry placement should be between 60-80 hours (or across 6-8 weeks). A relevant local festival cultural experience will be offered by the Film and Television department and/or students can nominate which festival they attend as relevant to their chosen specialisation.</p>",
        "<p>This subject will be delivered via pre-placement seminars, individual consultation, festival and work placement attendance, documentation of placement and festival experience through journal writing and archiving of relevant materials and in-class oral reporting.</p>",
        "<p>Any overseas or interstate travel is at the student's own expense. All required travel during the placement/cultural experience must comply with the Student Travel and Transport Policy.</p>"
