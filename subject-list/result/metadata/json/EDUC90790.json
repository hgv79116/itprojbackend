        "<p>The capstone draws on theory, knowledge, and skills gained throughout the Master of Applied Positive Psychology program. Students reflect upon and further explore key learnings, identifying pathways beyond completion of the MAPP program. The subject further explores a variety of research-related approaches and issues affecting study validity.</p>",
        "<p>Applied to the capstone project, students design a project grounded in the science of positive psychology, wellbeing, or related disciplines, within the context of their choice. Students will be expected to critically review relevant literature, document planning decisions, and consider methods for evaluating intervention/study outcomes. The subject culminates with students sharing their capstone project in written and verbal forms.</p>"
