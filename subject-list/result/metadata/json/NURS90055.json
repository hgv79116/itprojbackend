        "<p>This is a capstone subject in which students will further consolidate and apply the knowledge they have acquired from Nursing Science 1, 2 &amp; 3, Nursing Assessment and Care, Clients With Acute and Chronic Illness, Clients with Complex Health States and case-based learning scenarios which feature complex patient health problems.<br/><br/>In the <strong><em>clinical skills laboratory</em></strong> students will refine and consolidate their procedural skills utilising a self-directed learning approach. Emphasis will also be placed on performing such skills in a time-efficient manner.<br/><br/>In the <strong><em>clinical practicum</em></strong>, under the guidance of clinical educators and preceptors, students focus on the transition from nursing student to registered nurse with the goal of achieving readiness to practice as a beginning registered nurse.<br/><br/>The major focus for the clinical practicum component of this subject is to further build the student\u2019s knowledge and skills of the assessment and management of patients experiencing specific health problems and to develop an understanding of the accountability requirements of the registered nurse. On completion of the subject it is expected that students is able to carry the expected load of a new graduate by caring for 4 patients independently with minimal supervision.</p>",
