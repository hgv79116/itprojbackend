    "overview": [
        "<p>The aim of this subject will be to enhance the theoretical and skill base of direct practice in social work. Emphasis will be given to innovative and advanced approaches in line with recent developments in professional practice with individuals. The subject will be taught using interactive groups as well as formal lectures. This will enable students to participate in an opportunity to integrate and advance theoretical and practice knowledge in relation to an evidence base for psychosocial practices in the field. Lecture topics will include an appraisal of professional expertise in social work, psychosocial assessment and the therapeutic alliance. New developments in key direct practice approaches such as psychodynamic, behavioural, group work and postmodernist paradigms will be explored both from a critical theoretical and skills based perspective.</p>"
