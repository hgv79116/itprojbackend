        "<p>The subject examines how designers, employing the medium of public event and spectacle, reimagine public space, taking something familiar and transforming it into something surprising, unexpected and remarkable providing a context for the student to develop their own hypothetical, ephemeral design project in a series of six design studios.</p>"
