The Continuing Education Program has been especially designed to assist the student in gaining the skills necessary to succeed in their BSc Hons/BBiomed Hons. The program consists of a lecture series and number of workshops covering all of the assessment tasks in the Honours year including information relating to oral presentations, critical review of the literature, poster presentations, preparations of literature reviews, assignments, abstracts, posters and the research thesis. The Departmental Research in Progress program includes presentations encompassing a wide range of topics of central interest to contemporary biomedical research presented by external invited speakers and PhD students within the department.</p>"
