        "<p>This subject builds on the knowledge obtained in the Electrophysiological Assessment A subject. Students will have the opportunity to examine the principles and practices associated with advanced auditory evoked potential and vestibular assessment.</p>",
        "<p>This subject is designed to develop a theoretical knowledge of electrophysiologic measurement in clinical audiology and neuro-otology, and in conjunction with the Clinical Audiology course, be able to perform and interpret the full range of electrophysiologic assessments. This subject comprises the following topics:</p>",
        "<ul><li>auditory evoked potentials (middle latency response, cortical responses, event related potentials, brain mapping or topographic analysis of evoked potentials);</li><li>use of electrical stimuli for AEPs;</li><li>clinical uses of AEPs including assessment of hearing loss;</li><li>central auditory processing deficits and correlation with psychoacoustic assessment methods; and</li><li>electrophysiologic measures of balance function.</li></ul>"
