    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject examines contemporary theories and research into the acquisition and development of language, communication and early literacy skills in typically developing children and the impact of language delay and disorder, disability, learning difficulties and deafness on these interrelated processes. It introduces the subsystems of language and explores the development of language, including sign language, from preverbal communication through to complex language and discourse. Tools and strategies to support observation, classification and assessment of communication and language abilities are also explored. The subject addresses the impacts of learning difficulties, deafness, disability and neurodiversity on language and communication and presents current research on developing communication and language in diverse learners, including those using\u202fAuslan\u202for\u202fAugmentative and Alternative Communication to communicate.</p>"
