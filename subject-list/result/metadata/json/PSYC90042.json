    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject covers topics such as the process of central nervous system development, and the impact of cerebral insult on the process of development. Theoretical issues, including recovery of function and cerebral plasticity, are addressed with reference to Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders common to children (such as head injury, epilepsy, cerebral infection, attention deficits, learning disabilities, and the autistic spectrum of disorders). Clinical practice in child neuropsychology is also addressed with reference to topics such as neuropsychological assessment procedures, family interventions, and behavioural management.</p>"
