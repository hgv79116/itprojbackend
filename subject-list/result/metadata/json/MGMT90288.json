    "overview": [
        "<p>Indigenous business and leadership are most often practiced in capitalist systems where values of private capital accumulation reign. Whilst more socially focused business strategies are gaining popularity, businesses still operate for a primary profit motive because of the dominant operating environment. This subject explores a wide spectrum of business ethics issues in the context of Indigenous culture and philosophy, and factors that should be considered in addressing the central tension for Indigenous business and leadership that being profit vs purpose. Drawing upon Native and Indigenous philosophies and values, students will investigate, discuss, and present culturally based solutions and methods that Indigenous-managed businesses and organizations can anticipate and plan for future ethical problems.</p>",
        "<p>This course opens with a consideration of Indigenous philosophy and practical wisdom alongside Dewey\u2019s pragmatist approach to ethics and Howard Bowen\u2019s philosophy of business ethics pertaining to business\u2019s roles in society. These foundations will support students to critically examine and discuss the meaning of \u201cIndigenous\u201d as it pertains to cultures and values. From this point students will transform and expand these ethical principles into Indigenous contexts, and then and apply these Indigenous-grounded ethical principles to organization management.</p>"
