    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides a detailed review and analysis of the ways in which the procurement and delivery of construction and engineering projects are changing to meet the demand for more efficient infrastructure, including improved 'whole of life\u2019 outcomes and the reduction of claims and disputes. There is a particular focus on integrated project delivery, collaborative contracting and new technology. The subject covers a number of the current and emerging approaches to the procurement, contracting and delivery of construction and engineering projects and reviews a number of case studies from Australia, the United Kingdom and elsewhere.</p>",
