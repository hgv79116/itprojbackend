        "<p>The Property capstone is undertaken in a studio environment where the knowledge gained in prior property subjects is consolidated into a real-world project. Topics covered include business planning, site analysis, statutory planning analysis, markets and marketability, construction, financial feasibility, sensitivity and risk analyses, development funding, and property valuation. Broader urban planning concepts and sustainability in development are also covered.</p>",
        "<p>Students in the Property capstone work in small groups where they are required to source and analyse potential property development sites, carry out high level feasibilities, choose an optimal business case, and develop multiple design / development options for a site. Detailed site, market and marketability analyses are also carried out, and statutory planning, financial feasibility and risk analysis are used to determine whether a project should proceed beyond feasibility stage.</p>"
