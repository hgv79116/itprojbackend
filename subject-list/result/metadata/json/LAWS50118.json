        "<p>This subject will consider the complex challenges involved in regulating civil liberties in a democratic state. The subject will focus on the ways in which legal protection for civil liberties may enhance democracy.</p>",
        "<p>The topics covered in this course include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>A theoretical framework of democracy and civil liberties;</li><li>How the law protects liberty and democracy; and</li><li>How the law regulates fundamental freedoms and political rights such as:<ul><li>citizen participation in elections;</li><li>freedom of expression in a democracy;</li><li>freedoms of assembly and protest;</li><li>freedom of association; and</li><li>equality and non-discrimination rights.</li></ul></li></ul>",
        "<p>Case law from Australia and the United States concerning specific examples of the conflict between the protection of civil liberties and government policy will be examined. Case studies will include government leaks and the right of citizens to be informed about state activities, how government control of protest and dissent limits political participation, and the banning of political organisations in the name of state security. These case studies will consider the tensions between freedom and democracy, and the way law both protects and restricts civil liberties.</p>",
        "<p>The subject will adopt an interdisciplinary and comparative approach by drawing upon literature in political philosophy, political science and historical studies. The subject canvasses competing conceptions of liberty, equality and democracy, aiming to critically analyse law\u2019s regulation of civil liberties in a democratic context.</p>"
