        "<p>As a scientist, it is not only important to be able to experiment, research and discover, it is also vital that you can communicate your research effectively in a variety of ways. Even the most brilliant research is wasted if no one knows it has been done or if your target audience is unable to understand it.</p>",
        "<p>In this subject you will develop your written and oral communication skills to ensure that you communicate your science as effectively as possible. We will cover effective science writing and oral presentations across a number of formats: writing a thesis; preparing, submitting and publishing journal papers; searching for, evaluating and citing appropriate references; peer review, making the most of conferences; applying for grants and jobs; and using social media to publicise your research.</p>",
        "<p>You will have multiple opportunities to practice, receive feedback and improve both your oral and written communication skills.</p>",
        "<p>Please note: students must be undertaking their own research in order to enrol in this subject.</p>"
