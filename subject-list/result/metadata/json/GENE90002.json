        "<p>This subject will examine the roles of both genetic and environmental determinants in the expression of complex disease traits and cancer. Principles of genetic and genomic testing will be investigated and students will learn to apply these in clinical case-based scenarios.</p>",
        "<p><em>This curriculum is based on the genetic knowledge requirements of the Human Genetics Society of Australasia (HGSA Board of Censors for Genetic Counselling, which governs the certification of genetic counsellors in Australia. The course will be delivered via a combination of on-line content and case-based face-to-face tutorials.</em></p>"
