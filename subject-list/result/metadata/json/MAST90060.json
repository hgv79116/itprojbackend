    "overview": [
        "<p>The goal of statistical mechanics is to describe the behaviour of bulk matter starting from a physical description of the interactions between its microscopic constituents. This subject introduces the Gibbs probability distributions of classical statistical mechanics, the relations to thermodynamics and the modern theory of phase transitions and critical phenomena. The central concepts of critical exponents, universality and scaling are emphasized throughout. Applications include the ideal gases, magnets, fluids, one-dimensional Ising and Potts lattice spin models, random walks and percolation as well as approximate methods of solution.</p>"
