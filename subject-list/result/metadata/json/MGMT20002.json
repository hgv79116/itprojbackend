    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject explores how the production of goods and services are managed within and across organisations, with a focus on the role of processes and projects. Process-related topics include process analysis, design and implementation. Tools such as lean operations and six-sigma method for achieving process improvements will be introduced. Under projects, all the key phases in managing projects will be discussed, including project conception, planning, implementation and closure. Frameworks and tools will be used for effective project modelling and management. Each element is linked back to operational performance outcomes and competitiveness.</p>"
