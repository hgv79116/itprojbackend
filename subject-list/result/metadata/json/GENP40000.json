        "<p>The student will conduct an original research project under the supervision of an academic staff member in the Department of General Practice from February to November. The student will be introduced to current literature and to the research techniques used in the specialised area in which their research sits. The research project may form part of a larger current study, by focussing on one small aspect, or it may be especially designed for the student by a researcher with shared interests. In either case it is expected that the work will culminate in an original research publication.</p>",
