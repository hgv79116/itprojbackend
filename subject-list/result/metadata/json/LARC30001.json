        "<p>This subject introduces landscape as three-dimensional space. Aspects of site grading and earthwork manipulation will be explored, including their experiential and functional implications. The Importance of landform modelling to the design vocabulary of landscape architecture will be introduced, alongside principles of technical implementation and representation techniques.</p>",
