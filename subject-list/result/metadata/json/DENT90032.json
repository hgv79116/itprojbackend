        "<p>Building on skills developed in DENT90031 Research Design 1, this subject will provide students with the opportunity to formulate a research question and develop a research proposal. This subject will provide students with the practical knowledge required to design and plan a research project with consideration given to the process and requirements of ethics approval and selection of appropriate research methods. Students will also enhance their oral and written communication skills as they present components of their proposal across the semester for supervisor and peer feedback.</p>",
