        "<p>This is an introductory subject designed to enable students to acquire the basic tools necessary for critically reading about and carrying out quantitative empirical research in applied linguistics. Students will be given practice in the application of statistics in the analysis of data obtained from research and will be introduced to the use of computers with statistical packages to analyse data. Throughout, there will be a focus on the practicality and usefulness of the skills developed for the tasks of understanding research literature in Applied Linguistics, and of carrying out research in settings relevant to students. No prior knowledge of mathematics or of statistical procedures will be assumed.</p>"
