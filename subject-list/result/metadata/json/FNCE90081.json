    "overview": [
        "<p>The Applied Research Project is an ideal subject to further develop and strengthen students\u2019 research skills by working on a semester-long independent research project. In the industry pathway students will be working on real-world projects. As such, this subject offers an ideal path to secure a job in the finance industry if students perform well on their project. In the academic pathway students will work on an academic research project which will develop skills for students wanting to pursue graduate research opportunities.</p>",
        "<p>This subject is only available to students enrolled in the Master of Finance or Master of Finance (Enhanced). Students may enrol in this subject only with the prior permission of the Program Director. <br/><br/>Students have the option of two pathways:</p>",
        "<p><strong>Pathway A - Industry</strong>, is recommended for students in the Master of Finance. Students in Pathway A will spend time working directly with an Industry Partner. The exact time commitment will be agreed with each Industry Partner. For Pathway A, a list of industry projects will be advertised on Canvas and students can apply indicating their interest in specific topics. Students will be selected following an interview with the subject coordinator.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Pathway B - Academic Research</strong>, is recommended for students in the Master of Finance (Enhanced). Students in Pathway B are encouraged to select a research topic which aligns with their previous and/or future career activities or interests. For Pathway B, students must discuss possible proposals with the subject coordinator and then submit a detailed research proposal at least three weeks before the start of semester, and approval of the proposal must be finalised before the start of the semester. </p>",
