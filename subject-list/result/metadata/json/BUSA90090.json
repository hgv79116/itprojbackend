        "<p>This course is designed to prepare managers for the newly developing financial services industry, in particular the banking industry. The subject addresses three main issues related to the financial services industry. First, the conceptual issues underlying the financial services industry in order to help students develop a broad view of the management function in financial services. Second, a generic set of tools for managing return and the various kinds of risk facing managers in the financial services industry. Third, regulatory changes that have occurred due to the recent financial crisis. A key component of the subject is an online bank simulation game that will enhance insights in these three issues.</p>"
