        "<p>This subject is designed for students of non-Chinese speaking background who have completed Chinese 3 and Chinese 4 (previously offered as Chinese 2A and 2B), or equivalent. Students will build on the knowledge gained through their previous studies and broaden their reading, listening comprehension and speaking skills.</p>",
        "<p>Students will develop their ability to communicate in Chinese at a beginning-advanced level and their analytical skills of the Chinese language through engaging with a range of topics concerning contemporary Chinese society and culture. Their linguistic competence will be enhanced through exposure to Chinese materials dealing with a variety of socio-cultural situations, writing and presenting opinion pieces on current issues in Chinese, and participating in group discussions. Study activities will be supported with linguistic and cultural resources, including background information in brief English passages, along with video, audio and additional reading materials introducing the cultural topics.</p>",
        "<p>By the conclusion of this subject students should have a better understanding of Chinese cultural practices. They will be more competent in communicating in Chinese on a variety of topics in both spoken and written forms.</p>"
