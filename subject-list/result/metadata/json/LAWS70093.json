    "overview": [
        "<p>The concept of development has been crucial to structuring international legal relations from the end of World War II to the present day. During that time, international law and institutions have taken on \u2018development\u2019 as a primary project. In both the public and economic domains, the vast majority of international institutions engage with the development project in some shape or form. <br/><br/>This subject invites students to think about the nature and importance of development and its relation to international law. The history of development in relation to imperialism, decolonisation, the Cold War and globalisation means that this set of relations is complex and dynamic. Understanding it is crucial to understanding the place of international law, and the work development does in the contemporary world.</p>",
