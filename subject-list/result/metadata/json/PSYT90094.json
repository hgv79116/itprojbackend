    "overview": [
        "<p>This is one of two capstone subject options, taught in the final semester of the Master of Psychiatry course. As such, it aims to help students integrate the diverse knowledge and skills acquired in the previous five semesters to prepare them for their transition to professional practice.</p>",
        "<p> </p>",
        "<p>Psychiatrists have diverse professional roles apart from their core clinical role. They require up-to-date knowledge and skills in, amongst other areas:</p>",
        "<ul><li>the evaluation and conduct of research</li><li>mental health services policy, economics and service provision</li><li>administration and team and service leadership</li><li>teaching of medical students, psychiatry trainees and students of other disciplines, including the skills of supervision and mentorship</li><li>psychiatric ethics</li><li>the medicolegal dimensions of psychiatry, including mental health legislation</li><li>community engagement, e.g., advocacy for mental health care; involvement in public education and debate about mental health issues; the mental health needs of diverse social and cultural groups; the public communication of psychiatric knowledge</li><li>working constructively with other disciplines engaged in mental health care</li><li>promotion of the health and well-being of themselves, their colleagues and co-workers</li></ul>",
        "<p> </p>",
        "<p>This subject aims to address these needs by building on and revisiting the material of the previous five semesters (and on the students\u2019 developing clinical experience); and by using diverse teaching methods to promote integration of this knowledge, a more sophisticated understanding and greater competence.</p>",
        "<p> </p>",
        "<p>The teaching period itself consists of 12-half day attendances, each half day consisting of two sessions. The 24 sessions will address the diverse topics listed above, will do so in a variety of ways and will involve invited experts relevant to each topic. For some sessions, small groups of students will be assigned to prepare and contribute, every student having one opportunity to do so during the semester.</p>",
        "<p> </p>",
        "<p>A variety of formats are used, including: debates; expert panels; mock trials; updates of several fields and subspecialties by relevant experts; presentations by leading researchers about their own research career in psychiatry, but also discussing how to get published and how to advance one\u2019s own career; registrars presenting their own experience of research. History, social sciences, literature and film will be employed selectively to help develop perspectives on the achievements as well as the errors and abuses of psychiatry, and the challenges and opportunities facing the profession.</p>",
        "<p> </p>",
        "<p>Psychiatric research will be addressed in several ways. For some students, the Master of Psychiatry (342AA) is a prelude to a research higher degree and this subject will facilitate their transition. For all students, staying abreast of research is fundamental to good professional practice, and this subject will address the critical evaluation of research, literature searches and topic reviews.</p>"
