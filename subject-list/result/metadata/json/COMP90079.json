To enable part-time study, part-time students may take one subject in a single semester. A mark for the subject/s will not be awarded until the entire 100 points of enrollment has been completed. All subjects are offered in both semester 1 and 2.</p>",
        "<p>Satisfactory completion of the research proposal (in parts 1 and 2) are required to progress to parts 3 and 4.</p>",
