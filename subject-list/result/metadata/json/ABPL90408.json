        "<p>Spatial Analytics is the study of geospatial digital data, information, knowledge and models to understand trends, complexities and inform decision process. The subject explores approaches at the intersection of spatial information, statistics and spatial analytics to further students\u2019 understanding of the built environment. </p>",
        "<p>The new science of cities is driven by the deluge of data that enables the mapping of new geographies that can be explored, analysed and synthesized. Studies of urban settlements require a deeper knowledge of digital data and how to access, interrogate and synthesis such data. </p>",
        "<p>A range of research methods will be taught in combination with case studies to provide fundamental skills in Python, spatial analysis and sharpen critical spatial and analytical thinking. At the end you will have a set of Jupyter Notebooks in Python that can be deployed in future cases such as health, urban planning and real estate for evidence-based decision making.</p>"
