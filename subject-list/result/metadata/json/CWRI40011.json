        "<p>Students will read graphic fiction and non-fiction with a focus on 20th century writers such as Robert Crumb, Art Spiegelman, Alison Bechdel, Chris Ware, Marjane Satrapi, Charles Burns, Bruce Mutard and Shaun Tan. Students will also read into comics theory, cultural theory, and contemporary criticism of the medium, and discuss the history and innovations of this emerging field of writing practice. Students will work to produce their own original graphic narrative: this can be fictional, autobiographical, biographical or journalistic. Guest tutors will present intensive masterclasses on drawing and storyboarding; no prior artistic experience is required.</p>"
