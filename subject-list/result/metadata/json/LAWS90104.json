        "<p>The subject will cover the relationship of statutory to constitutional norms, particularly with respect to US copyright\u2019s accommodation of freedom of expression. The copyright 'Subject Matter' topic will include applied art and computer programs \u2013 works whose protection courts have not easily resolved. Ownership will focus on the peculiarities of the US works made for hire doctrine. The 'Formalities' topic will explore the extent to which formalities still condition the exercise of copyright in the US. The 'Exclusive Rights' topic will include analysis of the scope of rights in the online environment. The 'Exceptions' topic will concentrate on 'fair use', and will consider its 'portability' particularly in light of calls to incorporate 'fair use' into other countries\u2019 copyright laws, including Australia\u2019s. Remedies will address enforcement, including the liability of online service providers</p>",
