    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject builds on participants' prior experience and expertise in Indigenous research. It is expected that participants will be near completion of, or have recently completed, their Research Higher Degree (RHD), and that they are now in a position to develop leadership skills and capacity in, or involving, research.</p>",
        "<p>In this subject, Indigenous research is defined as research carried out - in any discipline area - by students who are of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent. It may also include research on Indigenous topics. A quota, and selection criteria, will apply (see Entry Requirements for the <a href=\"https://preview.handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2021/courses/gc-irl\">Graduate Certificate in Indigenous Research and Leadership</a>).</p>",
        "<p>The curriculum is underpinned by contemporary theories and models of leadership, with a particular focus on Indigenous perspectives. Participants will develop leadership skills relevant to academic contexts such as research supervision; research grants and project management; and the mentoring of junior researchers, especially Indigenous. They will also develop skills \u2013 individually and collaboratively - in applying research findings and/or an evidence base to issues arising in professional, community and industry contexts.</p>",
        "<p>Assessment includes a verbal presentation; a short group project; and a longer individual research project tailored to the participant\u2019s work context and career.</p>"
