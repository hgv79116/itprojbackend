        "<p>Humans have always exploited their surroundings and engineered changes for survival and advancement. In recent years, advances have given rise to radically new biomedical technologies. This subject explores the biomedical advancements that have and will continue to shape the human species and the associated moral and political implications. The subject focuses on biomedical technologies/interventions by examining them through ethical, historical, philosophical and social science lenses. We will discuss and critically consider the potential impact and ramifications of such technologies on human life, culture and society. Examples of concepts and questions that could be explored are:</p>",
        "<ul><li>What social inequities could arise from biomedical interventions?</li><li>What might be the intended and unintended outcomes of our ability to engineer the human genome? For example, what are the implications of removing \u2018defective\u2019 genes?</li><li>What are the ethical implications of taking the evolution of <em>Homo sapiens</em> into our own hands?  </li><li>Who should decide on the trajectory of human evolution, and on what basis?</li><li>How can misuse of biomedical technologies be prevented?</li><li>Should there be obstacles to the development of biomedical technologies that might improve human life?</li></ul>"
