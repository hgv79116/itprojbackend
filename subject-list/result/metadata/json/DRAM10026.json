    "overview": [
        "<p><strong>This subject has been designed and developed for online delivery and assessment only.</strong></p>",
        "<p><em>Love going to the theatre? Want to learn more about one of Australia\u2019s flagship theatre companies? </em></p>",
        "<p>This <em>online</em> subject provides an<em> inside look</em> at the art, craft and business of Melbourne Theatre Company (MTC). Emphasis is placed on you (the audience) and your appreciation of the work of the playwright, director, actor, designer, producer and critic.</p>",
        "<p>Upon completion you should be able to demonstrate a vocabulary of theatre terms and recognise the contributions of various theatre artists in an organisation like MTC.</p>",
        "<p>The subject is taught wholly online in a self-service model, with a requirement to attend shows (or view live-streamed content) and participate in a series of moderated online group discussions.</p>",
        "<p>This subject will enhance your knowledge of one of Melbourne\u2019s significant cultural institutions and hopefully enliven the experience of going to the theatre in Australia\u2019s greatest city, Melbourne.</p>",
        "<p>Since no theatre appreciation subject is complete without an experience of the live theatrical event, you\u2019ll be provided with tickets to see two productions from the MTC subscription season and the opportunity to attend pre/post show discussions for both works. The only pre-requisite for this subject will be your life experience and a desire to engage with performance.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Delivery</strong></p>",
        "<p>The subject is taught online, however students are required to attend two live shows at the Melbourne Theatre Company (MTC), or attend two online streamed shows.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Additional Costs to Tuition Fees </strong></p>",
        "<p>There are NO additional costs for students. The tickets to attend two MTC shows are included with enrolment.</p>"
