    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject presents and explains the tools needed to teach people how to translate and interpret. It applies both to the training of professionals and to the use of translation and interpreting in the teaching of additional languages at all levels. The subject runs through the basics of classroom interactions, lesson planning, the mapping of learning objectives, and the design of curricula. Each step surveys the general teaching skills that can be applied to the teaching of translation and interpreting, providing hands-on activities and applications. Particular attention is paid to the use of online machine translation as a learning tool and to the historical and ideological reasons for traditional resistance to the use of translation in additional-language learning. </p>"
