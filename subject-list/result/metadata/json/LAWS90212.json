    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject explores the concept and actuality of civil society as it relates to the legal systems of states in Northeast and Southeast Asia. It introduces and then critiques the notion of civil society in Western political thought and evaluates its applicability in contemporary Asian states. It then explores select Asian understandings and experiences in depth through case studies of government regulation of civil society organisations and the way that civil society actors influence or seek to influence government and public opinion, by advocating better or different law and policy delivery or changes (law and or policy reform) in areas such as: citizenship and electoral participation; labour conditions; the media; and the intersection of gender with these arenas of contestation. The role of legal professional organisations as advocates for law reform will also be given particular attention. All subject materials will be in English and no knowledge of an Asian language is required, but of course students are encouraged to use non-English research materials as appropriate.</p>"
