        "<p><strong>AIMS</strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject introduces the fundamentals of mobile and wireless network design with a focus on the design and performance evaluation of the Radio Access Network of 2G, 3G and beyond cellular wireless networks. It develops the theoretical and conceptual underpinnings of the mathematical models of radio propagation, SINR, diversity and queuing that provide the basis for designing and performance evaluation of wireless networks.</p>",
        "<p>It introduces the specific design elements that are common to these networks with reference to the models and develops a framework for students to apply to solving their specific design problem in the project. Practical engineering constraints and requirements including radio and teletraffic performance targets are included in this approach, providing the network performance objective for the design.</p>",
        "<p>In the laboratory, students get hands-on exposure to analysis and design methodologies that are needed for current and emerging technologies and can learn how the modelling and simulation environments can be applied as tools for network design and performance evaluation. There is access to tools in Excel or MATLAB developed within the theoretical discourse that students utilise for their design and problem solving.</p>",
        "<p>Students are exposed to a range of technologies covering GSM/EDGE, WCDMA, HSDPA and LTE and the underlying multiple access techniques of FDAM, TDMA, CDMA and OFDMA. Models of these access technologies are covered and student learn how to apply these along with the propagation and queueing models to the design problems.<strong><br/><br/>INDICATIVE CONTENT<br/> </strong></p>",
