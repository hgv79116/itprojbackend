    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject builds on the core analytical skills and historical knowledge learned in Contextual Studies 1 by introducing core theories in theatre studies. Theory provides a systematic set of principles or terminologies, forming critical frameworks within which artistic practices may be formally discussed, interrogated, disseminated and developed.</p>",
        "<p>The key aim is for students to develop a qualitative self-reflective position through an understanding of the relationship of theory and practice. Students will form a greater contextualisation and articulation of the values and beliefs that drive or underpin their emerging artistic practice.</p>",
        "<p><br/><em>This subject is co-delivered to Bachelor of Fine Arts (Acting) and Bachelor of Fine Arts (Theatre) students.</em></p>"
