    "overview": [
        "<p>Students are required to complete 300 hours of placement (equivalent to a 40 day placement) in the University of Melbourne Psychology Clinic. Students will have the opportunity to observe a range of clinical presentations in adult and child patients and to begin functioning as a clinical psychologist, under the supervision of a supervisor. Students will receive experience in history taking, conducting a mental state examination, arriving at a case formulation and making treatment plans. Under supervision, students will be given the opportunity to develop competence in the provision of psychological treatments to individuals and (where possible) groups. In addition, the subject aims to give the student experience of professional psychology practice, including professional presentation, report writing and record keeping, managing a clinical caseload, and liaising with other professional practitioners.</p>",
        "<p>Over the 40 days, students are required to complete at least 15 hours of psychological assessments and to accrue a further 85 hours of face-to-face contact with patients (assessment and ongoing treatment of adults). Students are required to participate in regular weekly supervision. Supervisors for the Clinic placement will be registered as both psychologists and supervisors with the Psychology Board of Australia (PBA). Students undertaking this placement must be provisionally registered with the PBA and hold current Police and Working with Children's checks.</p>",
        "<p>In addition students are required to attend, and present cases seen on placement at a weekly group supervision session over the course of their enrolment in this subject.</p>"
