        "<p><span>The objective of this course is to provide an understanding of contemporary development issues and the relationships between development policies and international trade law in the context of a globalised world economy.</span></p>",
        "<p><span>The course begins with a review of some of the most prominent theories of economic development, describes approaches and definitions of economic development, tools and strategies for making development goals achievable, and explores views about the nature of economic, social and human prosperity. Students will undertake a comprehensive examination of development policies from the protectionism of the 1960s to the Post \u2018Washington consensus\u2019 paradigm, the challenges of mainstreaming development in the WTO (\u2018WTO\u2019), and the current crisis facing the Multilateral Trading System; the emergence of mega regional trading blocks, and the current debate on future International Trade Agreements will be  a focus of the course. Contemporary trade and development policy issues such the evolution of global value chains (\u2018GVCs\u2019) and their consequences for free trade agreements, beyond the border regulations, state-owned enterprises (\u2018STEs\u2019), and inequalities in opportunities and income will be examined from a perspective of international trade law and development policy, using case studies as appropriate.</span></p>",
        "<p><span>The course then present the rationales for free trade &amp; protection, the distributional consequences of trade, the impact of trade on employment and growth and the challenges presented by deeper international economic integration. The next sections of the course consider the World Trade Organization (WTO) and explore negotiation mechanisms and principles, the rules relating to market access, fair trade, safeguards and the system for dispute settlement and retaliation. The final section considers major issues facing the multilateral trading system and the role of developing countries in building a new international economic architecture.</span></p>",
