It will include topics such as: the collection and transcription of spoken language data, non-verbal communication, speech act theory, conversational implicature, conversation analysis and other approaches to discourse analysis such as ethnographical approaches, critical discourse analysis, and discourse and grammar. In addition, specific topics in discourse analysis and pragmatics will be covered such as narrative, identity positioning and stance, and discourse and technology. Students will learn how to design a small research project in discourse analysis and will have many opportunities to study samples of real-life language use from different perspectives.</p>"
