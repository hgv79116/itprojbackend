    "overview": [
        "<p>In this subject, students will learn about patient centred care and measurement of patient reported outcomes. Students will critically evaluate quality of recovery that extends well beyond the hospital discharge, the concept of real-time recovery feedback and the use of clinical ultrasound in the extended perioperative period. Team-based care and leadership issues, as well as consent, power of attorney and advanced care directives will be assessed. Cumulative assessment of the entire course\u2019s content will be evaluated by completion of a practicum consisting of electronic logbook of 50 clinical cases in the perioperative environment.</p>"
