        "<p>Students will travel to an international destination where they will have first-hand experience with historical and contemporary art, artists, galleries and museums. Students will be challenged to think beyond the limitations of their current art practice with emphasis placed on analysing and discussing art and its historical and institutional contexts.</p>",
        "<p>Through a series of field trips and tutorials, students will generate new work to be exhibited upon return to Melbourne. The Travelling Studio provides students with an opportunity to experience study in the context of another culture, build contacts and networks and consider the possibility of their art work contributing to and within a larger discourse.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Overseas Travel</strong></p>",
        "<p>In this subject, students will engage in an intensive study abroad experience and costs in addition to tuition fees may be incurred. Students may be eligible for financial assistance, or the Overseas Help Loan (OS-HELP Loans).</p>"
