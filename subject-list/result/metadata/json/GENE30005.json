        "<p>Genetics permeates all aspects of modern life, and modern genetic technologies are being developed at an unprecedented rate with impacts on our understanding of human biology and implications for medicine. This subject will expose students to a deeper understanding of human genetics including the origins of human genomes, rapidly advancing technologies to study and understand genomes, and how this can be used for understanding and improving human health, as well as the overarching ethical considerations.</p>",
        "<p>This subject focuses on several key areas in contemporary human genetics: the contributions mutation and natural selection make to human populations; the genetic basis of non-communicable diseases; strategies (technologies) for identifying the genetic basis of human disease; genetics of cancer and ageing; genetic counselling and gene by environment interactions. </p>"
