        "<p>This subject aims to provide a thorough grounding in stochastic techniques for actuarial studies. It covers some probability concepts including expectations, conditional expectations, joint and marginal distributions, moment generating function and probability generating function;  some commonly used probability distributions in insurance and finance; mixed distributions and actuarial applications; ordinary differential equations and actuarial applications; recursive techniques and actuarial applications; actuarial applications of Laws of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem; generating and Laplace transforms; actuarial applications of Brownian motion, geometric Brownian motion and lognormal distribution; stochastic integrals and Ito\u2019s formulae.</p>"
