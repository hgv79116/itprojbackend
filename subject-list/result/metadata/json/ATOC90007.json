        "<p>This subject will examine the fundamental dynamics controlling the behaviour of atmospheric processes on the mesoscale, including convection, atmospheric waves, mountain meteorology, and frontal systems. In addition, the two-way interactions between mesoscale and larger scale processes will be discussed. These discussions will be augmented by a detailed presentation of methodologies used to develop models of the atmosphere that are used for research and operational weather prediction.</p>"
