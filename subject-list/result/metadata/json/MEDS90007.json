    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces participants to a range of educational methods and their application in medical and surgical education. Benefits and challenges of traditional and new methods will be discussed. The subject draws heavily on participants\u2019 experiences and educational theory. During a one-day meeting, participants will \u2018teach\u2019 and \u2018learn\u2019 in simulated activities. In workplace-based activities, participants will be required to design, deliver and reflect on their own teaching.</p>",
        "<p>The overall aims of this subject are:</p>",
        "<ul><li>To provide participants with an opportunity to relate educational theory and practice</li><li>To promote critical discussion and reflection of current approaches to educational programs</li></ul>"
