    "overview": [
        "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This subject is an introduction to the developing world and development studies from the perspectives of Anthropology, Political Science, Economics, Sociology and Geography. Beginning with a critical examination of the legacies of colonialism, we will ask to what extent they can be argued to have created the current divide between the developed, global North and the developing or under-developed global South.</p>",
        "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We will then focus on the relationship between rich and poor countries in an increasingly globalised world, identifying the manifestations of global inequality and ways of addressing it. Students will also examine the roles of international organisations and global agendas such as the Sustainable Development Goals in mediating relations between global North and South. Key development issues such as poverty, aid, debt, trade, migration, climate change and sustainability will be investigated through the use of case studies from Africa, Latin America and Asia.</p>",
