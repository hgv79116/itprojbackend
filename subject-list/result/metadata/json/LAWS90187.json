    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces students to the economic analysis of the law as a set of tools for analysing the effect legal rules have on the way people behave. The subject explores the extent to which the principles of economics can be used to explain the workings of the legal system itself. Students will learn how to construct and critique basic economic models of the incentive/pressure associated with different legal rules and institutions.</p>",
        "<p>The topics covered in this subject include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>the Coase theorem</li><li>the choice between property and liability rules</li><li>the allocative effects of alternative liability rules (e.g. strict liability versus negligence)</li><li>the determination of remedies in civil claims (e.g. contract, tort)</li><li>considerations behind criminal law and enforcement</li><li>the economics of legal procedure</li><li>public choice.</li></ul>",
        "<p>Particular attention is paid to applying economic analysis to contemporaneous legal and policy controversies in Australia and Asia-Pacific.</p>"
