        "<p>Experiments in the subject will explore (a) the use of recombinant DNA analyses, (b) bacterial expression systems to produce and characterise recombinant protein, (c) identification of proteins by mass spectrometry; and (d) mammalian cell culture.</p>",
        "<p>Students will learn practical skills of how to record data and maintain experimental observations in laboratory notebooks, to search bioinformatic databases, and to construct and concisely write a scientific research paper based on their findings.  Students will also further develop their skills in performing biochemical calculations and solving problems by applying knowledge attained from practicals.</p>"
