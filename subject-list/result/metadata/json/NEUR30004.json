    "overview": [
        "<p>The subject explores the complexities of integrated neuroscience by focusing on examples of major sensory systems, and on complex brain functions involved in language, numeracy and other areas of cognition. These processes are considered from the perspective of normal brain operation, the organisation of neural circuitry and from an examination of the abnormalities underlying neurological disorders.</p>"
