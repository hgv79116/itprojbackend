        "<p>The focus of this studio subject is the development of both design thinking and dexterity with tools, and an increased awareness of communication strategies and practices, \u2013 specifically the generation and articulation of design possibilities through a series of studio-based projects.</p>",
        "<p>Through a study of visual design traditions using images, text and animated elements, drawing on visual cultural histories, students will expand their experience of communicating through image and text through a range of studio workshops to working with a range of design techniques and graphic methods. These workshops will be a combination of online contact time and independent study time.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Materials and Software<br/></strong>Adobe CC is required software for this subject. Please note that Adobe CC software is available in the labs on campus for all Breadth and Graphic Design students. <br/></p>"
