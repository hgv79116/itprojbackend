While the assessments are necessarily very similar across all 4 practicums, each will vary according to the demands of the practical work undertaken and the student\u2019s place in the sequence. This practicum represents the third stage of development. </p>",
        "<p>Students undertaking this subject will work on a large-scale practical project, through rehearsals and culminating in a performance, in order to develop, consolidate and apply the individual skills required for an opera production.</p>",

        "<p>Through either vocational placement in a professional opera company or an in-house University production, <strong>repetiteur</strong> students will strengthen and consolidate their skills in conducting, coaching and managing, as well as their knowledge and understandings of the rehearsal process, as applicable to all aspects of the repetiteurs' craft.</p>"
