    "overview": [
        "<p>Property Research and Analysis is a taught module that draws on theories and techniques to analyse various property-related research questions in an applied way through selected research-based studies demonstrating how these theories and techniques are applied. The specific focus on research in this subject provides the foundation for ABPL90362 Research Thesis \u2013 Property.</p>",
        "<p>The subject has two aims:</p>",
        "<ol><li>To equip students with the skills necessary to conduct rigorous and original research;</li><li>To provide them with an opportunity to develop a scholarly foundation and a theoretical framework for an investigation into a research topic determined by the student in conjunction with an academic supervisor. The academic supervisor will guide the student while undertaking ABPL90362 Research Thesis \u2013 Property.</li></ol>",
        "<p>The subject concentrates on the preliminary stages of research, from defining a research question through to planning and beginning implementation of the research. The output of students' work constitutes the basis for the empirical work conducted in ABPL90362 Research Thesis - Property and forms an integral part of the final research report of that subject.</p>",
        "<p>Together ABPL90363 Property Research Analysis and ABPL90362 Research Thesis - Property meet the 25-point research pathway to PhD requirement.</p>",
