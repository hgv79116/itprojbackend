    "overview": [
        "<p>The subject involves undertaking a summer-intensive research project requiring an independent investigation on an approved topic within one of the research groups in the Department of Biomedical Engineering. It is primarily intended for Master of Biomedical Engineering students. Each project is carried out under the supervision of a member of academic staff and where appropriate, a delegated co-supervisor from the research group. To enrol in this subject, the student must first discuss with and obtain approval from a potential supervisor.</p>",
        "<p>Through regular supervisory meetings, the students will be guided through the research process. This will include understanding existing literature; problem formulation; experiment design; data acquisition, analysis and synthesis. The emphasis here will be on attempting something novel, leading to new knowledge or understanding. </p>",
        "<p>It is expected that the Summer Research Experience subject will incorporate findings associated with both well-defined professional practice and research principles and will provide students with the opportunity to integrate technical knowledge and generic skills gained in earlier years.</p>"
