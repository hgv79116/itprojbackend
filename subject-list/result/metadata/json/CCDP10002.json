The subject is an overview and presentations of lectures on 20th and 21st century electronic art and the collaborations of inventors, artists, industry conditions and innovators that make it all possible. The subject will involve guest speakers on their work and discipline as well as a wide range of presentations on historical material and the newest developments in electronic and hybrid digital and analogue methods.</p>",
        "<p>Regular practical challenges throughout the semester will reinforce facility with the standard tools of the digital workstations and analogue techniques. Weekly journals will engage writing skills and critical thinking. Students will produce and present original electronic works in collaborative groups.</p>"
