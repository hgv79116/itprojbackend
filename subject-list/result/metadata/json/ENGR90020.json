    "overview": [
        "<p>Students will be introduced to selected topics from biomechanics, biomaterials, system biology and biorobotics. Students will also appreciate the use of Dynamic Programming, Markov Models and Optimal Control in the above areas. Students will be encouraged to develop critical and constructive thinking via reviewing the latest scientific publications as a part of an assignment to be selected from the above mentioned areas. Biomechanics will focus on the musculoskeletal system for both normal and pathological states. It will introduce quantitative methods to investigate musculoskeletal injuries and diseases (e.g. osteoporosis and osteoarthritis) and discuss the mechanical properties of bone and tissue, gait analysis and orthopaedic implant design. Biomaterials will address different materials (polymers, metals, ceramics and composites) used in contact with living tissue. A main focus in this part is to examine the application of materials in the physiological environment. Topics will include host reaction, testing and degradation of biomaterials in biological environment. System Biology will focus on the big picture discussing regulatory networks and pathways that lead to the changes in cellular and lower levels. Some aspects of Bioinformatics will also be appreciated. Biorobotics will focus of the use of robotics technology in various medical procedures, such as observation, surgical intervention, and rehabilitation / assistance. Current technological challenges will be discussed in view of the state-of-the-arts in the field today.<br/><br/></p>"
