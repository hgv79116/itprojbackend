        "<p>This subject aims to give students the knowledge of the cost planning processes involved in establishing and maintaining a client\u2019s budget within the multiple constraints of time, cost and quality. It provides students with the skills needed to effectively monitor the budget for a building project as design evolves prior to actual construction.</p>",
        "<p>This subject examines the allocation of costs to individual building elements as well as developing student\u2019s appreciation of costs, overheads and allowances that are attributed to the overall project cost.</p>",
        "<p>Topics covered include design economics, building morphology, sources and uses of cost data, the cost planning of engineering services, functional analysis, computerised estimating, cash flow forecasting, and the basics of costing sustainable building design features.</p>",
