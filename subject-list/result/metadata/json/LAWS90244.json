    "overview": [
        "<p>This course provides you with an overview of the operation of Japanese law and practise in what is traditionally described as a so-called civil law system. The course also addresses questions of legal theory and comparative law, and will introduce you to practical ways of approaching comparative law through analysis of some of the sociological and economic theories and debates about the nature and role of law in Japan. Your participation provides an opportunity for you to read and think about approaches to, and limitations of, comparative study of Asian legal systems.</p>",
        "<p>Law and practice are the foci of this course. You can expect to make extensive use of Japanese legislation and legal writing, as well as survey literature from sociology, history or politics. Based around a range of English-language resources, we use a range of teaching methods in this course, including lectures, seminars, class discussion, film, documentaries and the Internet.  </p>"
