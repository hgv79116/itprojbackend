        "<p>Students will develop an understanding of the music of Igor Stravinsky and be able to relate it to the composer's creative process and the broader cultural context. The impact of Stravinsky\u2019s music will also be explored through the study of selected works by other 20th-century composers. Topics covered will include a study of Stravinsky's output in relation to nationalism, impressionism, neoclassicism, collage and serial techniques, minimalist structures and scenic considerations.</p>"
