        "<p>The increasingly global nature of digital communication is producing a startling array of bodies taking responsibility for policy issues. These range from national governments to international policy organizations. Digital policy ranges from technical specifications and the allocation of spectra, to platform and content regulation, 'fake news' regulation in addition to safeguarding intellectual property and the protection of cultural heritage in addition to ethics of Artificial Intelligence. The international organizations have long histories (the International Telecommunications Union for example, founded in 1865) Some are non-governmental organisations or not-for-profit corporations, others are formed to administer treaties, or are organs of the United Nations.</p>",
        "<p>However, crucial knowledge for all professionals in today's data world is how these policies balance the demands of the data subject, digital industries and national governments in varying degrees, and all play host to major lobbies and diplomacy. Some bodies have significant influence over the activities of others: the World Trade Organisation\u2019s policy instruments have major impact on digital services.</p>",
        "<p>The subject will assess case studies and encourage critical debates of digital policy development.</p>"
