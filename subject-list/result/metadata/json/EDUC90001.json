        "<p>This subject focuses on effective presentation and/or facilitation in actual teaching contexts - specifically, lectures and/or small group settings. The diversity of teaching contexts is a feature of the subject with participants encouraged to consider their particular teaching setting and practice. Participants, in peer review groups, engage in reciprocal peer review of teaching, alternately taking on the roles of reviewer and reviewee. Participants also engage in a reciprocal peer review cycle with a department colleague.</p>"
