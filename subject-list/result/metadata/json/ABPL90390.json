    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is the culmination of each student's studies in the Master of Architectural Engineering. It will offer a range of opportunities for students to demonstrate an original approach to research and design synthesising, in architecture and engineering. The capstone thesis is co-taught between the faculty of Architecture, Building and Planning and the Melbourne School of Engineering, providing an interdisciplinary environment for students. The subject is designed to provide students with an enriching experience that immerses them in a dual architectural-engineering research and design environment, fit for the double accreditation of their degree.</p>",
        "<p>Students will be expected to demonstrate their aptitude to conduct research and contribute to the existing body of knowledge in architectural and engineering theory and practice.</p>",
        "<p>The specific outputs of the thesis in terms of design and research will be determined on a case by case basis, with course coordinator approval.</p>"
