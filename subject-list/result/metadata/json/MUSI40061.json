        "<p>Students will continue to develop a thorough technical background to cope with all stylistic demands and establish a sizeable concert repertory covering all styles. The subject includes advanced study of instrumental or vocal recital repertory and all related aspects of music performance.</p>",
        "<p>In order to contextualise their education within the best practices of local, national and international standards, students are expected to work competently and productively as team members both alone and in groups, for example participation in individual lessons and Concert Class/Orchestral related ensembles. In order to ensure the highest level of performance preparation, 100% attendance is expected.</p>",
        "<p>Students are to submit a proposed program of performance pieces for approval by the Head of Area. This is via the online Practical Examination Program Approval Form available from the Faculty\u2019s current students forms page. This must be submitted by the subject census date. This is to ensure students' sufficient time to revise their program if it is not approved.</p>",
        "<p>If students do not submit a Program Approval, they may still undertake the examination, the approval process is an academic measure for students to ensure that they are performing a repertoire that is endorsed by their Head of Area.</p>"
