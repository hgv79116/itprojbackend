    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject explores the connections between the evolution of exhibition practices of still and moving images, focusing on the work of Alfred Hitchcock as a case study. Hitchcock's films have been influenced by artists such as Sickert, Klee, Margritte, de Chirico and Dali and have also exerted a powerful influence on contemporary artists and filmmakers such as Stan Douglas, Douglas Gordon, Cindy Sherman and Chris Marker. Recently, a number of international exhibitions have documented the receptiveness of Hitchcock's films to the literary and visual arts of his time - from Pre-Raphaelite and Symbolist paintings to the writings of Edgar Allen Poe, German expressionism, surrealism and modernism. This subject seeks to establish Hitchcock's place in art history as well as within the film canon and to contextualise the Hitchcockian oeuvre both historically and aesthetically. It also explores the roles of film and art in the history of modernity. It interrogates the practice of exhibition - from silent film, through to developments with 3D and wide screen technologies (Vista Vision), to the remediation of Hitchcock's images in new media and popular culture.</p>"
