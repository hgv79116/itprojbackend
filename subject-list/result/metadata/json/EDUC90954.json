    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject focuses on Science Communication with a particular focus on uses of (digital) technologies. Science communicators have different roles as teachers, journalists, museum curators, each playing a major role in promoting public understanding of science. This subject examines the skills and experiences that participants bring and works with them to further develop their abilities as communicators of science, focusing on opportunities and affordances of using digital technologies. Common practices, goals and outcomes in science communication will be explored, and the mediating influence of beliefs, values and understandings of and about science discussed. In particular, the importance of reflecting a humanistic perspective on science, as recently described in the national curriculum, in order to better engage various audiences (i.e. students, general public etc.) will be discussed.</p>"
