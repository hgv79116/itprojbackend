        "<p><span>R_Lab</span><span> introduces students to the use of robots in the design and construction of buildings and structures, which provides a new set of opportunities for architects, engineers, and designers. Robots and the processes developed, enable the design of architectures and constructions while controlling uncertainties of complex systems in ways that humans cannot.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Allowing students to develop non-standard objects and structures of infinite variability creates novel design possibilities.</span><span> </span></p>",
        "<p> </p>",
        "<p><span>R_Lab</span><span> students learn robotic related skills and an understanding of the fabrication process to produce prototypes while developing an understanding of an established robotic fabrication workflow. Students demonstrate the capability to design structures for robotic fabrication, program robots to construct, and apply the workflow to an architectural application. The process will include iterative prototyping through fabrication. In their final project students will demonstrate an understanding of the robotic fabrication process and its architectural application, while creating an aesthetic object with a high level of formal complexity \u2013 generated through the use of parametric design principles.</span></p>",
