        "<p>The fields of human rights and development have provided an important focus for the promotion of women\u2018s equality and empowerment in the United Nations (UN) era. Even as new policies and programs have been advanced in the name of women\u2019s empowerment, we have also seen an intensification of economic exploitation and vulnerability to human rights abuse. This subject will trace the history and examine the impact of the strategies adopted to promote women\u2018s equality in both fields, and the links forged between them in rights-based approaches to development. The limitations as well as the potential of law and international institutions in promoting equality and social justice will be evaluated. Students will be challenged to assess how notions of \u2018equality\u2019, \u2018gender\u2018, \u2018human rights\u2019 and \u2018development\u2019 have been defined in law, policy and practice. In addition to the generalised overview, the subject will examine how issues of women, development and human rights translate in particular arenas, including contexts of conflict/peace building, and contexts of transnational labour regimes.</p>",
