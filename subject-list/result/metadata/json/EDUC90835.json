    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will develop Teacher Candidates\u2019 pedagogical content knowledge for the effective teaching and learning of the following mathematics content and proficiency strands from Foundation to Level 6:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Content Strand: Statistics and Probability</li><li>Proficiencies: Understanding, Fluency, Problem Solving, Reasoning.</li></ul>",
        "<p>Within this content strand, Candidates will analyse the development of key concepts in primary mathematics and identify critical progression points for children\u2019s learning. They will consider typical conceptions and misconceptions held by children, their likely causes, diagnostic tools to diagnose them and teaching strategies for changing them.</p>",
        "<p>Teacher Candidates will learn to critically evaluate mathematics programs, materials and teaching methods. Teacher Candidates will develop a mathematics unit in Statistics and Probability for use in primary mathematics classrooms.</p>",
        "<p>Candidates will consider research evidence related to selected key issues of teaching Statistics and Probability. They will examine cognitive and affective characteristics of mathematics classrooms that encourage deep learning in these content areas and in the proficiency strands.</p>",
        "<p>Candidates will be assisted to develop leadership skills to enable them to become future leaders of mathematics/numeracy in their future careers.</p>"
