        "<p>Images and visual information are integral parts of our daily lives. Image processing plays an important role in various practical applications among them: television, medical imaging modalities such as X-ray or ultrasound, photography, security, astronomy and remote sensing. This subject will introduce the fundamentals of image and video processing and manipulation. While image applications will be used for illustrations, the subject emphasizes on general principles of image processing rather than specific applications.</p>",
        "<p>This subject will cover the following topics:</p>",
        "<p>introduction to image processing, image acquisition and display, image perception, colour representations, image sampling, quantization and image quality measurement, point operations, linear image filtering and correlation, image transforms and sub-band decompositions, contrast and colour enhancement, eigenimages, image segmentation, image restoration, image compression, patch image analysis, video coding and analysis.</p>"
