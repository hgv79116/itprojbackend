    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will build on and integrate research knowledge from Research and Evidence 1 and Research and Evidence 2 to apply research concepts in the individual physiotherapy clinical practice streams. Specific content in this subject will focus on systematic reviews and meta-analyses, incorporating statistical analysis and critical appraisal relevant to such study designs. Clinical guidelines will also be a focus, emphasising possible processes for development as well as how they can be used to inform clinical practice and application of tools available for critical appraisal. Strategies for communicating research findings (eg posters, conference presentations, journal papers) will be explored. Application of measurement in clinical practice, including diagnostic accuracy, clinical decision rules and clinical utility, will be studied. Steps involved in developing a research proposal and strategies for incorporating evidence-based practice into daily clinical practice will draw together the three years of curriculum in this stream of subjects.</p>"
