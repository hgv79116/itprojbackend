        "<p><strong>Managerial Ethics and Business Environment:</strong></p>",
        "<p>In this subject, students learn about the societal context in which business operates, together with the skills for reasoning about ethical problems that arise in this context. The course examines the various stakeholders of business and discusses the obligations of corporations to those stakeholders. It considers strategies for achieving corporate social responsibility goals \u2013 such as environmental sustainability and social outcomes -- taking into account both the ethical case and the business case for such strategies. The course also examines a range of alternative approaches to moral reasoning as well as the applications of those approaches to the complex and dynamic ethical problems that confront leaders of modern organizations, both in Australia and in other cultures.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Innovation:</strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject will introduce students to a number of techniques and concepts covering (1) individual creativity and brainstorming, (2) team creativity, (3) innovation within small and large firms, and (4) how to link ideas from this innovation bootcamp to other subjects they take in the MBA course. The bootcamp is a 5\u2010day course. It is highly experiential, with a focus on workshops, skills practice, and real-world projects to help the students acquire practical skills.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Financial Reporting &amp; Analysis: </strong></p>",
        "<p>Accounting is the \u201clanguage of business,\u201d and accounting information is the basis for performance measurement, business contracting, and most operating, investing, and financing decisions that managers make. Financial accounting information affects how individuals outside a company perceive that company, and by extension, the resources available to the company to accomplish its objectives. An understanding of and the ability to use financial accounting information will be essential to your success as a professional manager. This subject is designed to provide students with foundation knowledge about external financial reporting by for-profit entities. This foundation knowledge not only provides the basis for correctly interpreting and using accounting information provided internally to managers for managerial decision making, but also provides the basis for using financial statements for more externally-focused judgments and decisions (e.g., assessing a firm\u2019s intrinsic value or to assess a firm\u2019s strengths and weaknesses relative to competitors).</p>",
        "<p><strong>Finance:</strong></p>",
        "<p>This is an introductory course of valuation and financial management. The course is designed for <strong><em>all </em></strong>MBA students with career interests in managing any organizations where cash flows matter. It is based on the principle that firms should be managed to increase the wealth of their shareholders, subject to the fulfilment of their contractual and legal obligations to other stakeholders. To this purpose, this subject will focus on the valuation of financial assets and selection of investment projects. It provides a good foundation for those who want to specialize in finance and choose many finance electives we offer in later terms. Furthermore, students will find that the principles learned here can be readily applied to their own personal financial planning and investments.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Marketing Management:</strong></p>",
        "<p>The Marketing subject focuses on the challenges faced by organisations in managing demand, and how to address those challenges with optimal demand-side strategies. To be successful, organisations have to be able to recognise, create, grow, and protect market-based assets that influence demand. Brand equity, the installed base of customers, and support from channels (e.g., intermediaries such as retailers) constitute the most important market-based assets that help produce market outcomes such as sales growth, price premiums, market share, customer share, customer retention, customer referrals, and addressable markets.</p>",
        "<p>In this subject, students will learn how (and which) marketing investments help develop market-based assets, how market-based assets translate into market outcomes, and how market outcomes in turn help in ensuring the long-term survival and success of organisations.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Personal Effectiveness 2:</strong></p>",
        "<p>The \u201cPersonal Effectiveness Program\u201d (PEP) runs across the two core modules and is designed to help students develop the skills and knowledge required to effectively manage the early stages of their career. PEP identifies specific needs of each individual student and then provides ongoing support, training, and opportunities to practice and perfect these skills. PEP focuses on three core areas.</p>",
        "<ol><li>Communication skills: These skills include effective presentations, verbal communication, written communication, and public speaking</li><li>Career development skills: These skills include case practice, interview skills, CV writing, networking, and business etiquette</li><li>Team skills: These skills include managing conflict, cultural awareness, giving and receiving feedback, and resilience.</li></ol>"
