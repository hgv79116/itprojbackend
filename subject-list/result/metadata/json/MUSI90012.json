        "<p>Beyond the examination and assessment requirements, beyond the tonal, beyond the meter this program aims to refresh the personal resource that ought to arouse the interest in unfamiliar music, and deepen appreciation of known works. Conventional wisdoms regarding aural training will also be examined, with acknowledgement of the various methods.</p>",
        "<p>Activities are centred on improving perception of pitch, stimulation of short and longer term memory, feel for rhythm, and a multiple intelligences approach to harmonic perception. Activities useful in teaching aural perception and discussion of resources and materials to help the teacher are incorporated.</p>"
