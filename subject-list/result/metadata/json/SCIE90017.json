    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject involves completion of an 80-100 hour science or technology work placement integrating academic learning in science areas of study, employability skills and attributes and an improved knowledge of science and technology organisations, workplace culture and career pathways. The placement is supplemented by pre- and post-placement classes designed to develop an understanding of science and technology professions, introduce skills for developing, identifying and articulating employability skills and attributes and linking them to employer requirements in the science and technology domains. Work conducted during the placement will be suitable for a graduate level of expertise and experience. While immersed in a work environment, students will be expected to challenge themselves by accepting roles and responsibilities that stretch their existing capabilities. They will interrogate the requirements of specific careers and continually monitor their own progress towards developing the necessary knowledge, skills and attributes to thrive in these roles.</p>",
        "<p>Students will be responsible for identifying a suitable work placement prior to the semester. Application for credit need to be submitted via the <a href=\"https://industry.science.unimelb.edu.au/index.php?r=studentRequest/create\">Internships Portal</a> at least 3 weeks prior to internship commencement and within the <a href=\"https://science.unimelb.edu.au/study/internship-subjects\">Key Dates</a> mentioned on the website.

        "<p>On completion of the subject, students will have completed and reported on a course-related project in a science or technology workplace. They will also have enhanced employability skills including communication, interpersonal, analytical and problem-solving, organisational and time-management, and an understanding of career planning and professional development.</p>"
