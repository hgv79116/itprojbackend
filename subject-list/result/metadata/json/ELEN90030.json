        "<p><strong>AIMS</strong></p>",
        "<p>Information Theory is the fundamental backbone of reliable communications, reliable data storage, and data compression. This subject provides the rigorous basis of `information', showing it to have deep links to the ability to reduce data to its essence, and to the ultimate limits to communication.</p>",
        "<p><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT</strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject is aimed at postgraduate (research) students. The subject material covers the core topics of Information Theory including: Shannon entropy, Mutual Information, lossless and lossy source coding, Shannon's celebrated channel capacity and channel coding theorem, differential entropy and the Gaussian channel. Technically the subject combines probabilistic models of idealised communication and the mathematics of applied probability.</p>"
