        "<p>This subject provides students with a sound knowledge base for decision making in relation to the management of health, nutrition and breeding programs of animals. Students will be introduced to integrated animal systems and the inter-relation of nutrition, health, genotype and environment, general anatomical organization and physiological function of animals, major body systems and their functions with emphasis on the digestive and reproductive systems; nutritional requirements of animals for maintenance and production, stages of growth and development from conception to maturity; reproductive management of animals for optimum fertility, new technology in animal breeding; the nature of animal diseases, immunity and its development; common causes of disease in animals, and animal behaviour, genetic and environmental influences, welfare issues affecting the production and management of animals. The subject will cover both extensively and intensively farmed species.</p>"
