    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject focuses on the role of the primary care nurse in providing patient centred care within the context of chronic disease management. The lived experience of patients with chronic conditions is explored alongside the scope of nurse practice in the provision of clinical care, psychosocial support and patient education within a multidisciplinary framework. This subject builds on the knowledge of the pre-requisite subject, NURS90104 Chronic Disease Management: Foundations, and assists nurses in promoting chronic disease self-management based on the chronic care model. Students who wish to complete the Graduate Certificate in Primary Care full time, over 6 months, can complete NURS90104 &amp; NURS90105 concurrently.</p>"
