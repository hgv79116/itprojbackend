    "overview": [
        "<p><strong>AIMS </strong><br/> <br/>This subject will focus on how risk analysis and management principles and techniques can be applied to engineering projects. The subject introduces a range of risk analysis techniques, which are put in the context of engineering projects and analysed using the framework of the risk standard (AS ISO 31000:2018). Risk is a fundamental concept that is applied to every engineering project, whether it is ascertaining the risk of health impacts of water treatment processes, prevention of loss of life by flood mitigation projects, or catastrophic losses caused by the failure of structure in earthquakes or storms. <br/>The subject is of particular relevance to students wishing to establish a career in Engineering management, but is also of relevance to a range of engineering design disciplines where design for the total life cycle of the product or infrastructure should be considered. <br/> <br/><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT </strong><br/> <br/>Topics covered include: an introduction to the history of engineering failures; the forms of risk and risk identification; project risk analysis; the sociological implications of acceptable risk; approaches to risk management, monitoring for compliance, risk perception and design implications. <br/><br/><br/></p>",
