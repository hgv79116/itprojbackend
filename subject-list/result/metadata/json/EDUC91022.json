    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject focuses on the theories and pedagogies that can be implemented in early childhood learning ecologies to support children\u2019s learning and multimodal literacies (linguistic, spatial, visual, aural, oral, kinesthetic). In contemporary society, the focus and purpose of becoming literate has changed dramatically, mainly as the consequence of new technologies in our everyday lives, both locally and globally. Literacy learning includes communicating our ideas and understandings and using a wide variety of multimodal texts. Specific emphasis is placed on foregrounding Indigenous Worldviews across literacies as well as understanding the relationship between literacies and building sustainable communities.</p>"
