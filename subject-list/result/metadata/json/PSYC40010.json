    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject runs over two semesters (25 credit points per semester). There are no scheduled classes for this subject. Instead students meet regularly with their supervisor and undertake a research project to obtain experience in all aspects of conducting and reporting an empirical research project. The thesis project will be submitted as two documents. The first comprises a draft introduction to the research report submitted as a hurdle requirement for formative feedback from the supervisor at the beginning of Semester 2. The second comprises a 9000 word research report submitted at the end of Semester 2, worth 100% of the marks for the subject.</p>"
