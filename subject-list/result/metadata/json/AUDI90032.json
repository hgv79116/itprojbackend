    "overview": [
        "<p>This first clinical practice subject introduces students to the speech pathology clinical setting including the management of clients and patients presenting for assessment and/or intervention. Clinical placement settings may include hospitals, community clinics, early intervention and specialist centres, schools, private practices, university clinics, residential aged care facilities and other relevant settings. A variety of clinical experiences will be offered including initial observation, followed by increasingly \u2018hands-on\u2019 experiences with infants, children, young people and/or adults throughout the clinical placement. In particular, this subject covers establishing rapport with clients, developing observational skills, interviewing, case history taking, and listening to and recording information accurately. To support student learning, students also attend workshops held at the University during semester. Topics include introduction to CBOS (2011) and COMPASS\u00ae, adult learning, peer learning, supervisory styles, reflective practice, clinical reasoning and case-based discussions.</p>"
