        "<p>This subject synthesises Teacher Candidates\u2019 understanding of the characteristics of professional knowledge, clinical practice and engagement for professional accountability in the secondary school context. Teacher Candidates will reflect critically on the ways in which educational theory and research informs practice. Teacher Candidates will recognise an area of practice which they identify as a professional learning priority and reference this to the relevant components of the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers.</p>",
        "<p> </p>",
        "<p>The school placement is focused on clinical teaching of designated learning areas in secondary classrooms. Teacher Candidates will demonstrate capacity to make sound clinical judgements and to independently deliver high impact clinical instruction for sustained periods using sequenced lessons and units of work. Teacher Candidates will demonstrate a high level of 21st century skills and their ability to develop these skills in students. Experienced Mentor Teachers will continue to support Teacher Candidates in collaboration with university-based academics who are also engaged in the on-campus teaching program.</p>",
        "<p> The Clinical Teaching Practice seminars are framed by the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers at the Graduate Level. At seminars, Teacher Candidates will engage in collaborative learning and critical reflection.</p>"
