        "<p>The research project is a Capstone option in the Master of Applied Psychology. This subject enables participants to draw on the expertise developed throughout the MAP program and apply it to a topic relevant to their coursework topics. The project is team-based to mirror the practical experience of those working in a range of fields such as marketing, public policy, consumer/social research, communications/advertising, business consulting, and many others.  The project will be developed and overseen by both a professional and academic mentor. The syndicate group will work in consultation with their practice and academic mentors to develop a project brief, undertake analysis, and prepare a professional report. </p>"
