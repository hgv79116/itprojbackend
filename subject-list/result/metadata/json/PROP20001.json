    "overview": [
        "<p>The subject considers the nature and operation of investment markets with a focus on three major asset classes; shares, bonds and property. It looks at the characteristics of these different investment options, especially in terms of the risks and returns associated with each. The module also introduces basic financial mathematics involving the time value of money, calculation of present and future values, and the computing of rates of return for investments or projects with property as a context. An introduction to the interpretation, analysis and use of financial statements (profit and loss statements, cash-flow statements and balance sheets) is provided. Finally, it considers the application of appropriate accounting and regulatory standards in interpretation of financial statements.</p>",
