    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is designed for students who commenced the Latin stream with some previous knowledge of Latin (VCE level or equivalent) and have completed Latin 4. Students examine Roman prose fiction through study of the Cena Trimalchionis from the Satyricon of Petronius. In addition, work is undertaken on grammar and syntax to revise, consolidate and extend students' knowledge of the language. Students who successfully complete this subject should be familiar with the structures and stylistic techniques of Roman prose fiction, be able to identify the central themes of the narrative, and understand the genre's parody of Roman social structures and mores. Students who complete this subject may progress to Latin 6.</p>"
