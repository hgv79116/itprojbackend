    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is part of a sequence of three or four parts (depending on the research project stream) taken in successive semesters that together constitute the 100-point research project offered through the Master of Science (Physics).</p>",
        "<p>In this subject, students undertake a substantial program of original research in one of the many research fields in which the School of Physics is active and internationally recognised: astrophysics, condensed matter physics, optics, and particle physics. The research may be experimental and/or theoretical in nature. It will be conducted under the supervision of a member of the School\u2019s academic staff. The results will be reported in the form of a substantial thesis. In most instances, it is expected that the results will also be submitted for publication in a learned scientific journal. As part of their introduction to the research topic, students will be required to complete a seminar series and/or reading course providing advanced theoretical and/or practical training in the field.</p>"
