        "<p>There is a need for civil engineers to increase their knowledge and skills in freight systems since they are actively involved in the planning, design, construction, maintenance and management of a range of freight infrastructure such as roads, bridges and ports. Civil engineers require expertise in freight systems to reduce the social and environmental costs from freight including safety, noise and emissions. Training in freight systems also provides opportunities for freight networks to become more productive and efficient increasing economic benefits for society.</p>",
        "<p>Freight infrastructure allows the freight system to operate, facilitating vital components of our economy, including production, distribution and trade.</p>",
        "<p>The purpose of the freight system relates to its role in providing a service for the economy. Freight transport is a derived demand; it does not exist for its own sake. The primary demand is for the consumption of goods where there is spatial separation. Goods are generally stored, processed and consumed at different locations. There is a need for goods to move to increase their value for producers, manufacturers and consumers. Freight can be considered as the economy in motion. Goods are transported as part of the economic activities of production, manufacturing and consumption.</p>",
        "<p><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT</strong></p>",
        "<p>Freight networks provide a service for producers and manufacturers allowing access to markets for the consumption of goods. The benefit of goods being transported relates to their increased value at their trip destination. Reduced transport operation costs leads to lower production and distribution costs that creates opportunities for lower priced goods.</p>"
