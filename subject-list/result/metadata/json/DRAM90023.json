    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject focuses on the application of dramaturgical practice in the rehearsal room in the lead up to performance outcomes. The subject is delivered through a variety of intensives and collaborative projects with students from other theatre courses (e.g. actors and directors).</p>",
        "<p>The projects may range in scale from table work to scene studies and rehearsed readings, and the focus of the subject is how to develop and apply a suitable dramaturgical practice within each context. The work in each project will span a range of possible activities including: reading/analysing script with a director; contextual research supporting the director\u2019s vision for the production/scene study; responding to work on the floor and identifying and discussing the implications of dramaturgical decisions.</p>",
        "<p>Drawing on the learning from Applied Dramaturgy 1, this subject will enable you to consolidate practice, leadership skills and understanding of dramaturgy in a range of contexts before undertaking your Independent Dramaturgy Project.</p>"
