        "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Graphs model networks of all types such as telecommunication, transport, computer and social networks. They also model physical structures such as crystals and abstract structures within computer algorithms.</p>",
        "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This subject is an introduction to the modern field of graph theory. It emphasises the relationship between proving theorems in mathematics and the construction of algorithms to find the solutions of mathematical problems within the context of graph theory. The subject provides material that supplements other areas of study such as operations research, computer science and discrete mathematics</p>"
