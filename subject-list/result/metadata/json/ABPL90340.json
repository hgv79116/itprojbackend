    "overview": [
        "<p>The subject engages with contemporary landscape architecture practice through guided investigation projects on materiality and technology. Students will select an area of interest from a list of nominated topics to investigate through research-design exercises. The subject emphasises exploratory investigations (which could extend to fabrication) and encourages the uncovering of new knowledge that can extend the possibilities of landscape architectural design.</p>",
        "<p> The subject establishes research-design approaches that are further reinforced in Design Research, Design Thesis and Landscape Practice subjects.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Incidental costs</strong></p>",
        "<p><em>Students will be required to purchase construction materials for the course including cost to cover CNC routing and 3d printing;  approx. $300  per person.</em></p>",
