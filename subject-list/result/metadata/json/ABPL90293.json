    "overview": [
        "<p>Steel and composite construction systems can take many forms when used to construct commercial or industrial buildings. This subject will introduce students to construction techniques and performance requirements that influence material selection for constructing low to medium rise office or apartment buildings, hospitals and institutional buildings, shopping centres and sporting facilities. Each project has characteristic structural forms and resultant methods of construction. Structural design concepts for steel, composite and hybrid construction systems are analysed and their influence on construction methods assessed. The topics covered include the interpretation of steel framed systems, industrial ground slabs, basement construction and site retention methods, piling systems and construction methods to suit various geotechnical conditions, composite construction, tilt slab construction methods, precast concrete building systems and hybrid floor construction systems.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Incidental costs</strong></p>",
        "<p>Students will be required to purchase personal protective equipment (steel-toed boots, hard-hat, hi-vis vest and safety goggles); Students may use equipment from a previous subject if these are in good working condition.</p>"
