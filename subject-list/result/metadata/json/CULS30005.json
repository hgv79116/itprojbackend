    "overview": [
        "<p>How have cities been imagined, navigated, and represented? What are some of the cultural, social, political, and environmental challenges that cities face in the 21<sup>st</sup> century? This subject examines how the city has been theorized as a core concept of modernity and modernization or represented through various aesthetic practices (photography, film, tv, literature, essays), moving from key cultural theorists of the city and urban life to case studies of city cultures and urban practices. By exploring everyday urban ecologies alongside creative and political interventions that transform urban life, the subject seeks to understand how cities are sites of pleasure, inclusion and diversity but also spaces of struggle, alienation and isolation.</p>"
