        "<p>How can you express yourself through drama to explore what\u2019s important to youth, and the world, today? This subject will explore how young people can be empowered through the interpretation and creation of plays and performances. Students will explore techniques and processes from a range of styles which emphasise a practical and hands-on approach, including a site visit. Students will explore different youth cultures, identities, and approaches to social justice through performance, experimenting with acting, directing, writing, slam poetry, design (sound, lighting, costumes, props) and digital media. Students do not need existing experience in drama, and the creative and presentational skills developed within this subject can be adapted to a range of professions including media and communications, education, law and business, and social justice.</p>"
