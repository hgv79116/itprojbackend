    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces students to aspects of professional practice for veterinarians, such as the role of the veterinarian in the community, characteristics of veterinary leadership and the skills required to work effectively as a team member and attend to the well-being of self and others. This subject also examines the major non-production animal industries in Australia and internationally, with a focus on the impact of management practices on the health and welfare of animal populations.</p>",
        "<p>Students will develop an appreciation of the major determinants of profitability, productivity and sustainability of these industries, be able to describe the basic principles of breeding, management, nutrition, animal welfare and disease control as they relate to non-production animal industries, and specify where veterinary input may be important. Students will gain an understanding of the ethical and legal frameworks that govern animal industries in Australia, assuring the safe, ethical and legal management of animals. Students will be given the opportunity to develop skills in risk assessment and handling of cattle, horses, sheep, dogs and cats before demonstrating their proficiency in the structured assessments.</p>"
