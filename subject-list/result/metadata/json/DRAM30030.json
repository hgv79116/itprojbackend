Strong ensemble skills are applied to different performance contexts and the rehearsal and performance of a public play under a professional director.</p>",
        "<p>In applying technical skills to advanced performance contexts and creative exercises, students develop a deeper understanding of the actor\u2019s process. The connection between the learning environment and industry expectations and practice completes the transition from student to professional actor.</p>"
