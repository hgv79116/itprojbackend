        "<p>Independent Research Project is an Arts Elective subject designed for students who want to enhance their own research skills and develop an independent (but supported) research project in an area of their choice. This subject provides students an opportunity to identify a research topic, write up a proposal and some key research questions. Across the semester the student will build their research project and aim to present a final paper that presents an original contribution to existing knowledge in the discipline. The student should gain skills in the independent development of a research project. It allows students to acquire the ability to both research and analyse a topic in order to deepen and extend their knowledge of one of the disciplines offered in the Bachelor of Arts.</p>",
        "<p>Independent Research Project functions as a mini- Honours experience for students who are interested in experiencing this prior to moving into study at 4th year. The essential requirements are: a viable research proposal and the agreement of an academic supervisor to guide the project and to assess the final research paper. Supervisions usually take place for 30 minute sessions every fortnight - or equivalent \u2013 across the semester. Once students have agreement on the proposal from the supervisor, please forward the proposal to the subject coordinator to request approval for enrollment in this subject.</p>"
