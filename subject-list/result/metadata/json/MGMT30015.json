    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject enhances students\u2019 understanding of what it means to work in an organisation and how to develop their own careers. It is suitable for all undergraduates wanting to succeed at work. Based on theories of career and organisational studies, the subject is designed to offer practical insights for getting into an organisation, focusing on the graduate employment process, getting along with others at work including self-management, politics, influence and ethics, and getting ahead by investing in human and social capital. The subject will also address contemporary careers issues such as the role of social media, gender, work-life management, issues of employability and what is career success. Through the use of reflection, experiential activities and case studies the workshops will examine how these theories can be applied at the individual level.</p>"
