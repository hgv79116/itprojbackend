    "overview": [
        "<p>Building Information Modelling (BIM) and its associated technologies and processes can integrate the project team and facilitate high-quality and cost-efficient work. This subject will introduce BIM principles and break the jargons around BIM topic. During tutorials, students will learn about most popular BIM software in the industry and will work with the software to create and manage building project information throughout design, construction and operation phases. In other words, the subject will focus on creating 2D and 3D representations of a building information model using Autodesk Revit Software. Later, Autodesk Navisworks software will be used for 3D models checking and detecting clashes in 3D models, following by developing a 4D model (construction sequencing) and finally developing 5D model (quantity extraction) of the project. Throughout the process, students will use Autodesk Fusion Team to collaborate with their teammates and share projects documents and information.</p>",
        "<p>This subject will involve the following software: Autodesk Revit, Autodesk Navisworks Manage.  Details of software availability and pricing are captured at <a href=\"https://msd.unimelb.edu.au/graduate-research/resources/it-support#software\">https://msd.unimelb.edu.au/graduate-research/resources/it-support#software</a></p>",
