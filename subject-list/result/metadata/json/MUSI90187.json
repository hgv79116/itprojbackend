    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides students with independent placements in music therapy as part of their capstone experience.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Placement</strong></p>",
        "<p>Students are required to complete 20 days (160-hours) of practical placement. Placements will be initiated by the student in most cases, and students will have the opportunity to establish novel music therapy programs informed by the latest theories and research about contemporary practices.</p>",
        "<p>In hospital or community settings, students will design a program that is suitable to the context of the placement. Students will then deliver the program, taking responsibility for sessions where appropriate and will evaluate and measure the benefit of the intervention.</p>",
        "<p>Tutorials will focus on professional development, and experiential group learning. Placements will be supervised by a local professional staff member as well as peer group supervision.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Accreditation Information:</strong> This subject contributes 160 hours to the 640 hours required for accreditation by the Australian Music Therapy Association.</p>"
