        "<p>Students in the Screen Producing specialisation will develop a screen project collaboratively or individually with the intent to take it to an audience or market. Projects will be self or team driven, through a combination of independent study and workshops. Implementing both creative and commercial skills developed throughout the course, students will develop a project suitable for pitching to the commercial or indie market, including financiers or alternative funding solutions.</p>",
        "<p>The project will enhance and showcase the student's future professional opportunities and extend their skill sets across the boundaries of higher education and into industry. This process will include research for both the project, and its potential platforms and audiences, as well as story and pitch materials of a professional standard.</p>",
        "<p>Working with other creative contributors or elements (through research and/or practice), students will define their role as producer within the project and develop a unified creative vision for a practical project that can be realised within a given budget, time and framework.</p>"
