    "overview": [
        "<p>The Applied Syndicate Project in the Master of Marketing Communications is a capstone option. Students will be assigned in small groups (2-4/group) to a Project Organisation operating in the Marketing, Communications and/or Media industries. Working in teams, they will undertake a structured marketing and communications or business development exercise pertinent to their industry. This will be supported by seminar work equipping the students with knowledge of approaches, tools and techniques for completing the task and an understanding of report formats appropriate for conveying the results. During the practicum, in-depth work will be undertaken in identifying the scope, opportunities, constraints and recommendations of the exercise. Students will learn to work with unstructured and incomplete information in real business settings, to develop research and networks to support their enquiry, to work successfully in teams, to present their findings and seek and receive constructive feedback in a range of settings. Students will also be encouraged to plan, reflect and modify their approaches to improve the outcomes of their efforts in managing the business project.</p>"
