    "overview": [
        "<p>The purpose of this subject is to develop experience with an entrepreneurial venture in a real-world environment. Student teams will be responsible for designing and building a small-scale project that is capable of trading for at least one full day during semester 1. Learning will involve putting lean start up and design thinking principles into action, including customer insight and validation as well as a simple financial analysis. The subject will also teach team skills including selection, structure, roles, and norm and process development. Reflexive exercises will heighten self-awareness as an entrepreneurial decision maker. Students will also acquire skills applying business performance review and critical analysis using customer insights in a practical setting.</p>"
