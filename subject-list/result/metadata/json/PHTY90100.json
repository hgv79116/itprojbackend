    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will be conducted predominantly in the clinical setting and will provide students with an opportunity to develop their clinical skills and to integrate their theoretical knowledge in neurological physiotherapy clinical practice. The emphasis in this subject is the application of clinical reasoning and evidence-based practice in the safe and effective assessment and management of individuals with neurological conditions in the clinical setting. This will apply in, communication, therapeutic interventions, advocacy and education working as a health professional within a team, with individuals and their carers, respecting their rights and choices within the healthcare setting. <br/><br/></p>"
