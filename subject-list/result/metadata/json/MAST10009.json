        "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This subject develops fundamental concepts and principles in mathematical analysis. Students should gain skills in the practical techniques of differential calculus, integral calculus and infinite series, and study selected applications of these techniques in mathematical modelling.</p>",
        "<p>Topics covered rigorous discussion of limits of sequences and of real-valued functions, continuity and differentiability; Mean Value Theorem and applications; Taylor polynomials; Riemann integration, techniques of integration and applications, improper integrals; infinite series, with applications to power series representations of elementary functions and their generation by Taylor series and to the representation of periodic functions by Fourier series; first order differential equations, second order linear differential equations with constant coefficients and selected applications.</p>"
