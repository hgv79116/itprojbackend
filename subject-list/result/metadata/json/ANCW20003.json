        "<p>The Egyptians are one of the most captivating peoples of the ancient world, and their distinctive civilisation, which flourished in the Nile Valley from the early third millennium BCE onwards, continues to fascinate scholars and enthusiasts alike. This unique subject, designed to coincide with the opening of the National Gallery of Victoria's (NGV) 2024 Melbourne Winter Masterpieces exhibition, \u2018Pharaoh\u2019, will delve into the multifaceted character of Egyptian civilisation that endured until the Roman conquest of Egypt in 30 BCE. Through a systematic survey spanning the Old, Middle, and New Kingdoms as well as the Late and Ptolemaic Periods, students will be introduced to the historical and cultural achievements of ancient Egypt.</p>",
        "<p>The subject will explore the monuments, reliefs, inscriptions, literature, and material culture of the royal rulers from the Egyptian dynasties, dating from about 2950-30 BCE (with brief interruptions of foreign rule). This comprehensive study will provide students with unparalleled insights into the power and authority of one of the ancient world's most enduring civilisations. The focus on object-based learning is a vital aspect of this subject. Knowledge acquisition will be enriched through the study and handling of authentic ancient objects in the University\u2019s collections and through the viewing and discussion of works in the NGV\u2019s exhibition.</p>"
