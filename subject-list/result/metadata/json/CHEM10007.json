        "<p>On completion, the student should have an understanding of the nature of matter, solutions and gases, the chemical change related to equilibrium, energy and kinetics, and the nature of redox processes; and structures and functional groups in organic molecules.</p>",
        "<p>In the practical component, students should develop basic laboratory skills (observation, analytical techniques, report writing) and an appreciation of the health and safety issues associated with the safe handling and disposal of laboratory chemicals.</p>",
        "<p>The subject provides an introduction to the nature of matter: elements, atoms, ions and molecules; the electronic structure of atoms and ions; bond formation, including covalent, ionic, metallic, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals; solubility and the solution state; ions and hydration; the behaviour of gases; the mole concept; concentrations; stoichiometry; acids, bases, neutralisation reactions and salt formation; acid/base strength and the pH scale; energy and chemical systems; rates of reaction and reaction order; catalysis and enzymes; chemical equilibrium; the equilibrium constant, Ka, Kb, stability constants and solubility products; redox reactions and redox potentials; organic molecules: structure, nomenclature and functional groups; hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity; and biologically significant macromolecules.</p>",
        "<p>This subject will provide the student with the opportunity to establish and develop the following generic skills: the ability to use conceptual models and gather and rationalise data, problem-solving and critical thinking.</p>"
