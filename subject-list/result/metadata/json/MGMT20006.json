    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject explores three important areas of concern facing managers of multinational corporations. First, it examines the relationship and balance between global integration and local responsiveness that lies at the heart of understanding strategies of multinational corporations (MNCs). This brings with it the question of organisational structure and design and aspects of the internal management of the MNC such as subsidiary tasks, control and coordination. Second, it delves into the many factors within host economies that impact on MNC operations. Third, it also deals with contemporary issues around managing MNCs such as international strategic alliances, MNCs from emerging economies, and sustainability.</p>"
