    "overview": [
        "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This subject focuses on gene structure, function and regulation, which form the molecular basis of many important biological phenomena such as short-term organismal and cellular responses to rapid changes in environmental conditions and long-term controls of development. The molecular mechanisms underlying these phenomena are frequently exploited in biotechnology, medical and agricultural applications. The topics covered in this subject include gene structure; genome organisation; regulation of gene expression by transcriptional, translational and post-translational control; and regulatory networks. These processes are presented in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, using examples in model organisms and humans. Understanding of these processes is considered in the context of significant historical genetic experiments and through the application of current molecular genetic and genomic techniques. </p>"
