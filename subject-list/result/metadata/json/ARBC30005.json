        "<p>Students will be fine-tuning what they have learnt so far of Arabic structures, will be adding to their already substantial knowledge of Arabic syntax, and will be sharpening their analytical skills. In the process, they will be reading Arabic poetry, medieval tales, literary prose, informative writing, studies, evaluative, persuasive and argumentative articles, and producing their own informative, imaginative, evaluative, persuasive and argumentative writing. They will also gain insight into the ongoing debate on classical Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic and Colloquial Arabic, and the future of the Arabic language.</p>",
        "<p>Students will be watching/listening to TV programs on current affairs and on topics of personal and/or professional interest, interviews and short lectures which will also help to further develop their listening comprehension skills. They will take part in discussions and debates expressing opinions and conveying emotions on a range of more complex cultural, social and political topics. While developing students\u2019 proficiency in the language, the various activities will also help them gain a deeper understanding about the history and culture of the Middle East and the Arab World, and of Islam and modern politics.</p>"
