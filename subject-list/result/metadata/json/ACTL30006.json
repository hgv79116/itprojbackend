        "<p>This subject introduces actuarial students to stochastic asset liability modelling. It aims to expand the student's knowledge of basic actuarial principles in the fields of investments and asset management. Topics include: utility theory, stochastic dominance, measures of investment risk, portfolio theory, models of asset returns, asset liability modelling, equilibrium models, the efficient markets hypothesis, stochastic models of security prices and Brownian Motion and its application.</p>"
