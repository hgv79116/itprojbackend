        "<p>This subject aims to provide opportunities for students to gain an understanding in, and extend the practice of biomedical research. <br/><br/>The student will conduct an original research project in a basic or clinical research laboratory under the supervision of a research scientist from the Dept during the period February to November.<br/><br/>The student will be introduced to current literature and techniques in specialised areas.<br/><br/>The research project will form part of a larger project or the basis of an expanded project. In both cases the work may culminate in an original research publication.<br/><br/></p>"
