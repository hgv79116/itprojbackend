        "<p>This subject builds on the understandings developed in EDUC90906 Integrating Language &amp; Clinical Practice to extend Teacher Candidates\u2019 pedagogical knowledge and skills in order to improve language, literacy and numeracy outcomes for all students. Teacher Candidates will extend their knowledge of the multiple forms of language and literacy required for the critical comprehension and production of complex texts within their discipline/s. Teacher Candidates will identify the numeracy demands within their disciplines and the implications for teaching. This subject builds their capacity to assess and respond to specialised language, literacy and numeracy learning needs in order to cater for diverse learners within their disciplines, including: EAL, Indigenous, and learners with a range of abilities. Teacher Candidates will relate their understandings of these issues to their ongoing teaching practice.</p>",
        "<p>Evidence is presented to demonstrate the importance of language, literacy and numeracy skills for success at school, future learning and outcomes.</p>"
