        "<p><span>Evidence supports physiotherapist-led therapeutic clinical exercise as a primary intervention for health across the lifespan. This subject aims to meet the demands of the current working environment by developing students' understanding of strength and conditioning principles, incorporating clinical therapeutic exercise prescription and outcome measurements relevant to well-being and health conditions across the lifespan.  Students will achieve this through a combination of online resources and interactive practical classes, designed to advance their exercise prescription and implementation skills of various exercises across the lifespan.</span></p>"
