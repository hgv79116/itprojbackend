    "overview": [
        "<p>Discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace represent an overwhelming majority of total complaints made to anti-discrimination authorities. Equality and discrimination at work remain pressing concerns for employees, managers and, more broadly, for society. Achieving equality is elusive and, indeed, the very meaning of equality is highly contested.</p>",
        "<p>This subject explores the legal meanings of equality, with a focus on the frameworks through which Australian parliaments have sought to address inequality, discrimination and harassment. It examines federal and state laws that deal with discrimination, including the four federal laws, the <em>Equal Opportunity Act 2010</em> (Vic) and the adverse action provisions in the<em> Fair Work Act 2009 </em>(Cth). Consideration is given to discrimination based on race, sex, disability, and pregnancy and family responsibilities. The lecturers in this subject combine many years of academic scholarship in this area, engagement in law reform debates and practical client-focused legal advice</p>",
        "<p>This subject provides an examination of the development and current scope of Australian equality and discrimination law, as relevant in employment and work relationships. It will focus on federal and Victorian jurisdictions.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>A study of the framework and key features of federal and state legislative provisions dealing with equality and discrimination in the employment context, including the<em>Equal Opportunity Act 2010 </em>(Vic), the <em>Racial Discrimination Act 1975 </em>(Cth), the <em>Sex Discrimination Act 1984 </em>(Cth), the <em>Disability Discrimination Act 1992 </em>(Cth) and the<em>Age Discrimination Act 2004 </em>(Cth)</li><li>An examination of the general protection provisions in the <em>Fair Work Act 2009</em> (Cth), including redress for certain types of adverse action</li><li>Debates regarding the meaning of equality, discrimination and other contested concepts such as choice, especially as choice relates to carer responsibilities</li><li>The <em>Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006</em> (Vic), and its potential impact in the interpretation of the <em>Victorian Equal Opportunity Act</em></li><li>Conciliation, dispute resolution and remedies</li><li>Alternative regulatory regimes, including the National Employment Standards, equal remuneration provisions under the <em>Fair Work Act</em>, contract law and occupational health and safety issues such as bullying</li><li>Current processes of legislative revision at federal and state level</li><li>The potential for future developments in the field.</li></ul>",
