    "overview": [
        "<p>International investment law is one of the fastest growing fields of public international law. The field \u2013 today largely focused on the global network of bilateral treaties on investment protection \u2013 affects the ways in which states can regulate the operation of foreign investment. Over the last two decades, there has been exponential growth both in the formation of investment treaties and in the invocation of their unique systems of dispute settlement (against developed and developing states alike). This subject offers in-depth, targeted analysis of the various sources of investment law, their protections and the growing jurisprudence of investor-state arbitral tribunals.</p>",
        "<p>The subject begins by tracing the historical, political and economic causes for the development of a plurality of international legal rules governing foreign investment across customary international law, bilateral and regional investment treaties. The subject takes a comparative approach to examining the unique elements of dispute resolution in this field (which confer standing on private foreign actors to bring international claims against states) in light of key institutional differences with other international adjudicatory forums (including the World Trade Organization and the International Court of Justice).</p>",
        "<p>Substantively, students will explore key cases in detail to critically evaluate the impact of investment law (such as guarantees of compensation in the event of expropriation of foreign assets) across a range of normative values. In particular, the subject will examine a broad set of controversies surrounding the impact of investment treaty disciplines on regulatory autonomy, environmental and health regulation, development strategies and the human rights of citizens in host states.</p>"
