    "overview": [
        "<p>This course is an introduction to algebraic number theory. Algebraic number theory studies the structure of the integers and algebraic numbers, combining methods from commutative algebra, complex analysis, and Galois theory. This subject covers the basic theory of number fields, rings of integers and Dedekind domains, zeta functions, decomposition of primes in number fields and ramification, the ideal class group, and local fields. Additional topics may include Dirichlet L-functions and Dirichlet\u2019s theorem; quadratic forms and the theorem of Hasse-Minkowski; local and global class field theory; adeles; and other topics of interest. </p>"
