    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject examines the major extensive animal production systems in Australia and internationally, with a focus on the impact of management practices on the health and welfare of animal populations. Through case-based syndicate work relevant to the major extensive production systems (beef cattle, dairy cattle, sheep, camelids and goats), students will develop an appreciation of the major determinants of profitability, productivity and sustainability of these industries, be able to describe the basic principles of breeding, management, nutrition, animal welfare and disease control as they relate to extensive animal production systems, and be able to specify where veterinary input may be important. Students will gain an understanding of the ethical and legal frameworks that govern the major extensive livestock industries in Australia, assuring the safe, ethical and legal production of food and fibre products.</p>"
