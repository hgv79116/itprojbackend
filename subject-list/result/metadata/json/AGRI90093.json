    "overview": [
        "<p>A common and important role that agricultural scientists and agri-business service providers play is within agricultural research projects or initiatives of agricultural industries and government targeting changes in practice or adoption amongst the farming population or in particular rural communities/catchments.   This subject will provide students with the theory and practice of agricultural extension.  Agricultural extension encompasses the practices involved in designing, delivering and evaluating interventions that facilitate desired change within a target population related to improved economic, environmental or social outcomes.</p>",
        "<p>The subject covers the four main aspects of contemporary agricultural extension considerations: the history and philosophy of extension and extension policy in a global context; social theories of change; design principles for agricultural extension within an agricultural knowledge and innovation system; delivery strategies, methods and tools; evaluation of interventions and ethical dimensions of extension practice. </p>",
        "<p>To achieve competency and professionalism in each of these aspects, extension practitioners must understand both the practical dimensions of designing and delivering change projects as well as the development of theories of action that underpin the design and allow for critical testing and evaluation of strategies.  This includes understanding of target populations for particular agricultural change topics and the processes involved in change; the description and analysis of knowledge networks and communities of practice; how to construct learning and collaboration processes; processes of multi-stakeholder engagement and management, collaboration dynamics, and the political perspectives on change visions.</p>",
        "<p> </p>",
