    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject allows students to undertake a 3-6 month internship with a host organisation in an area relevant to their potential career destination. Students may undertake a defined research project within the host organisation and/or participate in team-based research or business activities, while also being exposed to the broader operational contexts of an organisation.</p>",
        "<p>The internship will provide students with the opportunity to apply their research skills and capacity in an organisational context, gain practical experience and build professional networks in order to further enhance their career options. Students will have the opportunity to further develop their employability skills including communication, interpersonal, analytical, problem-solving, organisational, project-management and time-management skills, and gain a greater understanding of career planning and professional development considerations and employer expectations.</p>",
        "<p>Prior to placement students may be required to undertake preparatory seminars and/or online training modules covering topics that will include professional standards of behaviour and ethical conduct, working in teams, time management and workplace networking.</p>",
        "<p>Placements must be approved by the student\u2019s supervisor in consultation with the Subject Coordinator.</p>",
        "<p>Students may be required to sign a confidentiality agreement and/or assign ownership of any intellectual property generated during the internship to the host organisation. If primary research is carried out during the internship, obtaining relevant ethics approval is the responsibility of the host organisation.</p>"
