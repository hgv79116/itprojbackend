    "overview": [
        "<p>What does it mean for a criminal justice intervention to be <em>effective</em>? Why is it important to know? For whom? How does government emphasis on the <em>impact</em> of criminal justice programs affect the design and funding of programs? And what does this focus on effectiveness mean for research priorities and methods? This subject considers questions such as these in exploring how, why, and for whom criminal justice \u2018evidence\u2019 or \u2018knowledge\u2019 is produced. In this subject you will be asked to identify a particular criminal justice program or intervention (we will look at a range of examples), and to design an approach to discover whether or not it \u2018works\u2019 \u2013 thinking about <em>how, why </em>and<em> for whom</em>.</p>",
        "<p>The subject is divided into three broad areas. First we will examine what \u2018criminal justice governance\u2019 actually is, what it means for criminal justice policy and practice, and the implications for \u2018evidence\u2019 about programs and interventions. In the second section we will explore different approaches to measuring effectiveness and gathering knowledge about criminal justice practices and programs. The last part will focus on different <em>settings </em>(e.g. prisons, policing) and <em>subjects</em> of criminal justice research (e.g. justice-involved young people), and the impact that different kinds of knowledge might have. Throughout, we will examine professional and political issues about the role and application of research in criminal justice, as well as ethical issues about engaging in research with vulnerable and offending populations.</p>"
