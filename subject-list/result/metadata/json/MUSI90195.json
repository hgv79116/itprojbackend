    "overview": [
        "<p>Professional Practice 3 is a work experience subject for students to continue observations and gain further experience of music performance teaching.</p>",
        "<p>Observations of teaching practice will continue in a wide variety of music education contexts including community music education organisations, for example the MSO Pizzicato effect, Young Voices of Melbourne choirs, as well as schools and tertiary institutions. In these settings students will also participate in teaching individual students or groups under the supervision of an experienced teacher and Melbourne Conservatorium of Music academic staff.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Placement</strong></p>",
        "<p>Students are required to complete 14 days (84-hours) or equivalent of placement, and will continue to develop knowledge and skills as instrumental/vocal music practitioners. They will participate in detailed sequential planning of lessons / rehearsals and related activities, extensive supervised teaching of groups and individuals using appropriate curriculum and methodology, with a focus on effective learning and teaching in contemporary learning contexts.</p>",
        "<p>Students will receive regular feedback from their supervisors and Melbourne Conservatorium of Music staff will be present to grade some of this teaching. Students will also be assessed on an extensive personal-professional portfolio that will include detailed planning, implementation, assessment and post-implementation documentation of their teaching experiences.</p>",
        "<p>Prior to and immediately after the placement, students will attend compulsory seminars to provide an introduction to and reflections on these music performance teaching settings and relevant learning objectives.</p>",
        "<p>This subject encourages students who are preparing for a career in instrumental/vocal performance teaching to further consider best practice in instrumental music teaching and learning, to implement a range of differentiated teaching strategies, tools and resources and to become proficient reflective practitioners.</p>"
