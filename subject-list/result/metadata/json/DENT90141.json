    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will enable students to develop their knowledge and practical skills in preparation for person-centred clinical dental practice. Students will apply knowledge of disease processes, anatomy, common materials, equipment and instrumentation, and techniques for the management of caries (decay), periodontal (gum) diseases and tooth loss. Students will undertake tasks on manikins to develop skills in taking radiographs, preparing and restoring lost tooth structure (fillings), periodontal cleaning, the construction of complete dentures, and infection control. They will also learn the procedures for performing a patient history, examination and treatment planning. Students will learn about correct posture, safety, and working as a team (assistant and operator) in the dental operatory during the provision of these procedures.</p>",
        "<p>Students will participate in a range of learning activities including lectures, online learning modules, and practical classes in a pre-clinical simulation environment.</p>"
