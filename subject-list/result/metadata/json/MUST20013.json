        "<p>This subject will introduce a range of stimulus requiring physical and vocal adjustments to best serve a breadth of narratives. Students will use established technical skills gained from Music Theatre Studio 2 across the three disciplines of acting, singing and dancing to adapt their individual professional instrument. This will allow students to begin incorporating style and character as required by given texts and choreography.</p>",
        "<p>Classes will include acting, movement, spoken-voice, dance techniques, solo singing and ensemble singing. Through skills-based performances and reflection, students will develop intermediate level knowledge of acting, singing, and dancing.</p>"
