        "<p>After completion of this subject, students will have comprehensive knowledge of the sono-anatomy and the skill in when and how to safely perform ultrasound-guided percutaneous procedures commonly performed in critical care including central and peripheral vascular access, drainage of effusions from the lung, heart and peritoneal cavities, and ultrasound-guided surgical airway procedures. Students will perform, interpret, write a report and submit a log-book of at least 15 ultrasound-guided studies and interpret and report on an additional 10 online studies.</p>"
