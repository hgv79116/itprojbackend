        "<p>After completion of this subject, students will have the knowledge for how to use ultrasound to improve diagnosis and procedures for patients in the pre-hospital setting. Students will have the knowledge to perform a clinical ultrasound to help determine the common causes of shock and cardiac arrest (peri-arrest), including focused ultrasound assessment of the heart, lungs abdomen and deep venous thrombosis (peri-arrest), and vascular systems. Students will have interpreted and written a report on 10 ultrasound studies. Students will have the knowledge to perform ultrasound-guided critical care procedures such as intravenous cannulation, thoracostomy, and percutaneous cannulation of the trachea</p>"
