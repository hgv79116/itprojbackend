        "<p>This subject aims to provide students with grounding in advanced linear regression analysis which includes multiple linear regression, Spearman's and Kendall's measures of correlation, principal component analysis and generalised linear models. This subject also focuses on explaining the fundamental concepts of Bayesian statistics, deriving Bayesian estimators, and describing and applying the essential concepts of credibility theory.  </p>"
