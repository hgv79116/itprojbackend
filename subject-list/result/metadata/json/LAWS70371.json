    "overview": [
        "<p>Paid work is central to the lives of most adults \u2013 it provides an income and is constitutive of identities. For society at large, the organisation of paid work relationships is crucial because of the need to produce goods and services and to protect those engaged in production. Regulation of these work relationships by law is, therefore, important.</p>",
        "<p>This subject provides a thematic overview of the legal regulation of work relationships in Australia in an industrial, social and political context. It examines how work relationships are regulated through statutory regimes as well as through contract law. A major focus of the subject is the <em>Fair Work Act 2009 </em>(Cth), which sets minimum employment conditions, regulates modern awards and workplace agreement-making, provides redress in relation to adverse action and also provides processes to deal with issues of sexual harassment and bullying at work. Anti-discrimination and equality law will also be examined.</p>",
        "<p>This subject is designed to be of particular assistance to students without previous (or recent) legal study in this area. <em>Principles of Employment Law</em> is compulsory for students who do not have a law degree from a common law jurisdiction, and it is strongly recommended that this subject be taken before any other employment and labour relations law subjects. <em>Principles of Employment Law</em> is also recommended for students who have not studied an equivalent subject in their law degree, or who have not done so recently. <em>Principles of Employment Law</em> is ideal for students undertaking a masters in another specialisation, or a Master of Laws, who wish to study one subject in the field of employment and labour relations law.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>The constitutional framework for Australian employment law</li><li>Statutory standards under the <em>Fair Work Act 2009</em> (Cth) including unfair dismissal, minimum wage rates, hours of work, leave, adverse action and 'right to request' regimes</li><li>The regulation of employment rights and working conditions by modern awards and enterprise agreements under the <em>Fair Work Act 2009 </em>(Cth)</li><li>Various aspects of the common law contract of employment</li><li>Anti-discrimination and equality law.</li></ul>"
