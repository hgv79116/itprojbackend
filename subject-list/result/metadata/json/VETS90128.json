    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject continues the integrated and inter-disciplinary approach to the study of function and dysfunction of body systems in animals introduced in year one of the DVM course. Students will build on their prior knowledge of organ function and dysfunction as they learn about the normal structure and function of the haemopoietic, integumentary and immune systems. They will explore the mechanisms of dysfunction and disease of these systems, the use of diagnostic imaging and clinical pathology in the evaluation and diagnosis of disease, and the principles of pharmacology and therapeutics in managing dysfunction and disease. Students will further develop their scientific and clinical reasoning skills, and their communication and teamwork skills, through collaborative case-based activities, integrating their disciplinary knowledge to evaluate clinical cases with multiple organ perturbation.</p>"
