        "<p>One of the primary themes driving environmental design thinking in the first decades of the 21st century is the concept of sustainability. Cities, other forms of human settlements, landscapes, and larger bio-geographical regions can be made to be more sustainable through various design interventions. This studio explores different ways of making sustainable urban environments by considering environmental (e.g., energy, water, materials, waste, ecology) and social/cultural (e.g., environment/behavior, cultural heritage conservation) factors and their incorporation into design interventions. Each semester, a selection of studio projects is offered, each with its own sites, design briefs, and studio leaders, which allow students to explore how their assigned site can be made more sustainable through various design interventions</p>",
