        "<p>Collage, as an artform, sparks creativity; disrupting and re-imagining images and ideas. This subject introduces students to \u2018playing with paper\u2019 through collage artmaking, and the creative and diverse possibilities this artform affords for connecting through social engagement. Students explore a range of analog, mixed-media collage processes and concepts, while examining through a critical lens how this relational act of artmaking forms new connections and framing of meaning-making and invites innovative formation of ideas or concepts. The unfolding artful inquiry in this subject involves engaging in a collaborative workshop and art exchange with local school children, to inform the subject\u2019s culminating negotiated community focused project incorporating artistic practice. The subject caters for students with varied prior experiences in visual arts practice. </p>"
