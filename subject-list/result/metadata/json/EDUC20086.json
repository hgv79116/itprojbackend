    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject explores the connection between drama/theatre activities and the promotion of wellbeing and prevention of illbeing in young people (in the early years through to post-secondary education).  A series of practical workshops will demonstrate ways in which drama-in-education techniques and processes can foster social and emotional learning in students in schools and young people in educational and community settings. In particular, the subject will focus on drama education\u2019s role regarding wellbeing and preventing illbeing in the areas such as self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, responsible decision-making through creativity and, playfulness. Student understandings of wellbeing and preventing illbeing will be contextualised through study of the latest research and practices in this area and will include relevant case studies and literature linked to drama education. Students will investigate current trends in the ways in which participation in drama/theatre can enrich young people\u2019s personal development and they will develop their own program of drama/theatre activities to illustrate their understanding of these trends.</p>"
