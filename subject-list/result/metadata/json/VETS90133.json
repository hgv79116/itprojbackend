        "<p>Upon completion of this subject, students will be able to apply an understanding of host, pathogen and environmental factors, and the way in which livestock are managed to diagnose and manage disease and suboptimal productivity at the herd and flock level. The multifactorial nature of disease is reviewed, and techniques for measurement and prediction of disease prevalence and population health introduced. An understanding and application of study design and critical appraisal of evidence will enable students to link theory to practice in the management of population health problems. </p>"
