        "<p>Generative AI has rapidly emerged across society, with much speculation about the opportunities and threats it poses.</p>",
        "<p>As a technology that fundamentally accepts natural language instruction, has an ability to reason on that language, and provides natural language output, there are parallels with the work performed by legal practitioners\u2014 who receive client instructions, apply legal expertise with the intent to achieve some outcome, and ordinarily provide a written output in the form of a contract, an advice or a submission.</p>",
        "<p>Advancements in tools that abstract away a lot of the underlying complexity mean that you no longer need to be a \"software developer\" to develop powerful, practical programs. Increasingly the focus is on having the domain expertise and imagination, rather than the technical skill.</p>",
        "<p>To best make use of the current capabilities of this technology, and to form a view on where it might lead, there is no substitute for lifting the hood and using the core components to build practical outputs. This provides a depth of understanding that cannot be obtained by theoretical study alone.</p>",
        "<p>Society will require legal practitioners who are able to understand, build, and critique the machinations of programs that use artificial intelligence (in particular, Generative AI). Accordingly, this timely and hands-on subject provides a much-needed set of tools for those engaged with law and technology: it steps through how to build Generative AI based programs for legal solutions, giving students an opportunity to put that learning into practice and become leaders in AI within their chosen career area.<br/><br/></p>",

        "<p><strong>Programmatic Access to Large Language Models</strong><br/>o How do software programs interact with LLMs?<br/>o How can we make LLM functionality accessible to legal users?</p>",
