        "<p>This subject provides students with the opportunity to plan and execute substantial research-based projects under supervision. Specific research projects will depend upon the availability of appropriate expertise, but may address a broad range of epidemiological issues.</p>",
        "<p>Students will be required to undertake two projects from two of the following categories: (i) a systematic literature review, (ii) a protocol design, (iii) an analysis of an existing data set, and (iv) a meta-analysis. They can complete these in any order. Students will give two oral presentations, one for each of their projects describing their findings and analyses.</p>",
        "<p>Students enrolled in the Master of Science (Epidemiology program) are required to complete a major 50-point Research Project. Students will need to discuss and receive approval for their proposed combination of Research Project subjects (as indicated below) with the course coordinator to ensure they will have completed a total of 50 points by the end of their course.</p>"
