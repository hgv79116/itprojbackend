        "<p>This subject is designed for students with some previous knowledge of Ancient Greek (VCE level or equivalent). Students translate and discuss the interpretation of a selected work of a Greek prose genre (e.g., philosophy or history).</p>",

On completion of this subject students should have consolidated their skills in working with Ancient Greek texts and have discovered some of the many important contributions which reading original texts can make to understanding the ancient world. Students who complete this subject may progress to Ancient Greek 4.</p>",
