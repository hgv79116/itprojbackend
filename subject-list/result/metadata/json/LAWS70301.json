        "<p><strong>This subject will be delivered online in 2020 over the scheduled dates.</strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject will provide students with international and comparative insights into a field of growing significance to practitioners in Australia and the region. It considers competition law questions in a broad context. It will examine the major systems of competition law enforcement that have been adopted by most countries in the world and their major differences, and how they compare to the Australian system. It will also consider the global competition law system, including the effects of national law and enforcement on other countries as well as the justifications and costs of a variety of international enforcement and harmonisation attempts which are underway. A special focus will also be given to the unique challenges faced by small economies in applying their competition laws in international markets. Recognition of such issues is important for any lawyer or scholar who wishes to apply competition law in a globalised world.</p>",
