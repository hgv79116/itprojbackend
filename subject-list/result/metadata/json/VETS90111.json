        "<p>This subject is dedicated to providing a deeper comprehension and understanding of dermatology, ophthalmology and welfare. The underlying pathophysiology of common conditions of dermatology and ophthalmology will be presented to enable the student to increase their understanding of disease processes as well as the practicalities of diagnostic and treatment techniques. This increased understanding encourages increased clinical confidence and will provide better patient outcomes for the veterinary practitioner. The increasingly important topic of animal welfare and how it relates to small animal practice will also be covered.</p>",
        "<p>Each topic will be covered in depth in separate tutorials. The case log and case studies that form part of the subject are designed for the student to reflect on the disease present to enable successful case outcomes. </p>"
