        "<p>In modern societies we are experiencing the great health challenges due to the way we live our lives. The driving force for our modern epidemic of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases is our own lifestyle, and at the leading edge of these factors is diet. This subject will look at the changes in diet over time with particular reference to our evolutionary development as a bipedal omnivore and the foods we evolved with and compare these to modern processed foods.</p>",
        "<p>Connections will be made with these changed dietary factors to our health situation today, effects on the microbial makeup of our guts, with an overview of specific diet related medical conditions that have become common in modern times. These health-related issues will also be viewed from within a human life cycle framework from conception to old age. The subject will also look into how nutrition research is done, showing students how to separate actual scientific evidence from the plethora of information presented in popular press books, web sites and blogs. </p>",
        "<p>The subject will combine lectures and tutorial activities that involve critically reviewing current scientific studies relating foods to health and disease and an assignment investigating in depth a specific food health connection. The topics to be covered are: </p>",
