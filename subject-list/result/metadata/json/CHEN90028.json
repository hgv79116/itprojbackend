This work could involve critical analysis of a topic, experimental research and/or development, theoretical modelling, process simulation and/or the solution of an industrial problem. Rigorous planning and scheduling of the project, time management, written and verbal technical communication, interpretation of results and team work will be required. Working off campus may be also be required, depending on the project.</p>",
