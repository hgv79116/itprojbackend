    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides an introduction to the fundamentals of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) from a public health perspective. Globally minded but locally focused, this subject examines the burden of disease associated with SRH and critically analyses significant factors of influence on SRH at the community and broader societal levels, including sexuality, violence, gender and sexual rights. Topics such as unmet need for contraception, fertility control, sex work and female cutting will also be covered. The development, implementation and evaluation of effective public health programs aimed at improving the SRH of communities will also be explored in the subject.</p>"
