        "<p>Our health is shaped by the conditions in which we are born, grow, live, work and age. The unequal distribution of money, power and resources from local to global levels has significant effects on health. This subject will provide an overview of Australian and international evidence on how social, economic, environmental and cultural processes affect population health. </p>",
        "<p><span>More specifically, the subject examines how health and wellbeing are shaped by a range of determinants including gender, poverty, socio-economic position, housing, employment and working conditions, race/ethnicity, discrimination and place. Students also explore structural barriers associated with colonialism, sexism, ableism, racism, stigma and violence. By integrating evidence from across these topics, this subject will use contemporary examples to unpack how health inequalities are generated and how health interventions might generate more equitable outcomes in population health</span></p>"
