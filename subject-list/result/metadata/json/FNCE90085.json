    "overview": [
        "<p>This is a practice-based capstone subject which enables students to develop their skills in the researching and production of a substantive piece of work (written, video and/or multi-media based) whilst also engaging with finance practitioners to identify current issues of interest to the broader society. The piece produced by each student will make use of the technical skills that they have developed during the first semester in the Master of Finance program and is designed to be consumed by a non-specialist audience.  The subject would be team-taught by faculty from both the Department of Finance in the Faculty of Business and Economics and the Centre for Advancing Journalism in the Faculty of Arts. Department of Finance faculty will be responsible for coordinating the guest lectures by finance practitioners that occur in the first half of the course. It is anticipated that the practitioners chosen would represent a diverse range of market participants including; regulators, financial institutions, consultants, industry bodies, corporates and consumer rights organisations. Faculty from the Centre for Advancing Journalism will take responsibility for the development of the technical research and writing skills necessary for the students to successfully produce their final piece of work.</p>"
