    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides an introduction to multivariate data analysis in the behavioural and social sciences, including the nature, rationale and application of a number of widely used multivariate data analysis models. For each model, issues covered include the nature of the model and its assumptions; situations in which the model might be applied; diagnostics for model adequacy; estimation and inference; interpretation; the use of statistical software for model-fitting. Models will be selected from multiple regression; logistic regression; an introduction to path analysis and structural equation modelling; multivariate analysis of variance and discriminant analysis; multilevel models; principal components analysis and factor analysis; models for multivariate categorical data; cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling.</p>",
        "<p>The first two lectures/tutorials of the subject will be taught on one day (six hours) in Orientation Week, thereby allowing students time to work on assessment tasks at the beginning of the semester.</p>"
