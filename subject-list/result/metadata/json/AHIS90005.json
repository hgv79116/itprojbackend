    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject examines the growth of the museum from its origins in the wunderkammer and antiquarian collections of the 16th century to the dynamic and constantly shifting field of possibilities available to museums today. The subject charts the progression of the museum from the private collections of the Renaissance and Baroque to the vast public institutional spaces of the late 18th and 19th centuries, and beyond. Students will also address the various functions of the museum in Western culture from its inception to the present day. Special attention will be given to the ways in which the changing objectives of the museum (e.g. entertainment, propaganda, education) are reflected in the architecture, design and the display techniques developed in different countries at different times. Students should develop an understanding of the relationship between museums and concepts of national and cultural identity, focusing on their development within Australia and internationally. </p>"
