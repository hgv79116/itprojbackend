        "<p>Reliability and quality are essential elements for today's products, processes and services, since failure in achieving either one can have major consequences.  This subject aims to offer a comprehensive overview of methodologies and tool to evaluate and demonstrate reliability and quality of components, equipment, processes and systems, supporting more assertive decision-making from engineers who wish to build a competitive edge in a wide variety of industries.</p>",
        "<p>This course consists of four main modules - 1) Probability and engineering statistics; 2) Reliability and maintenance engineering; 3) Quality management and process control, and 4) Design of experiments.  Topics include basic probability rules; random variables and distribution functions; functions of random variables; ANOVA; design of engineering experiments; methods of reliability; management and applications to quality control and the reliability assessment of the product in an engineering industry.</p>",
