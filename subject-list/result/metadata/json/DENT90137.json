        "<p>This subject is comprised of five components: direct restorative; removable prosthodontics; fixed prosthodontics; endodontics; and paediatric dentistry.</p>",
        "<p>Topics will include: restorative management of teeth having lost extensive amounts of tooth structure, including the concept of the life cycle of a restoration and longevity of restorations; methods of designing and placing complex restorations based on basic principles including design of a restoration to prevent further loss of tooth structure; the method of auxiliary retention for restorations and continuation of the use and selection of appropriate materials. This subject covers the techniques and materials used in the practice of the specialty areas of removable and fixed prosthodontics, endodontics and paediatric dentistry. In fixed prosthodontics, students will learn preparation of teeth for crowns in manikins.</p>"
