    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject brings together English and Theatre Studies majors for a culminating experience that reaffirms our love for what we do whilst simultaneously demonstrating the disciplinary skills and academic rigour that distinguish the study of literature and performance from other modes of enjoying these art forms. Each week students will engage with the history and future of our disciplines through a range of speakers and critical positions.</p>",
        "<p>Students will return to key genres, ideas, and approaches to studying literature and performance in ways that challenge and extend their knowledge and skills. They will pursue a project of their own devising, with guidance from staff, that showcases their love of literature and performance in original and exciting contexts, whether they be conceptual and research-based or practical and industry-facing. Students will decide on the most appropriate form for communicating their research to their desired audiences (essays, reviews, websites, podcasts, policy, etc.). An end-of-semester conference will offer the opportunity to share the results of the students\u2019 projects and celebrate the completion of the major.</p>"
