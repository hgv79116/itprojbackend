    "overview": [
        "<p>More and more companies engage in intrapreneurship (I.e., corporate entrepreneurship) to discover new ways to grow and become more innovative. Corporate entrepreneurship requires an   entrepreneurial mindset and the adoption of approaches that help companies to identify new business opportunities. However, to be successful, it is not sufficient to identify new business opportunities; companies also need to successfully implement these opportunities. In this subject, we will focus on how companies can successfully do so.</p>",
        "<p>The subject will discuss the topic from two perspectives. First, from the perspective of the organization at large: how to create an environment in which great ideas for new business opportunities are considered, nurtured and implemented? Second, from the perspective of the change agent, the \u2018entrepreneur in residence\u2019: how does the entrepreneur in residence make sure that their ideas are heard and acted upon? </p>",
        "<p>The subject will particularly focus on how to implement (rather than identify) opportunities for change and new ways to grow in a successful way, resulting in sustainable value creation for the organization.</p>",
        "<p>This subject will give you tools, methods and logic that will enable you to participate in or lead successful efforts in corporate entrepreneurship \u2013 in particular efforts to implement entrepreneurial opportunities.</p>"
