    "overview": [
        "<p>Note: This subject is only available to students enrolled in the Doctor of Optometry.</p>",
        "<p>In this subject, students will develop knowledge in the basic and clinical vision sciences in the areas of pharmacology, microbiology/immunology, evidence-based practice, anterior eye disease, clinical neuroscience, and binocular vision and paediatrics. To complement this, students will learn the theory of advanced clinical diagnostic tests and corrective devices, such as contact lenses and spectacle lenses, thus equipping them to both assess and manage patients in clinical practice. Throughout this subject, students will be required to integrate their learning, firstly through consolidation of their clinical routine and the practice of advanced clinical techniques, and then through application of these skills in the examination and management of patients in a clinical setting. Integration will also occur through the exploration of case studies that link key topics of basic sciences to clinical practice.</p>"
