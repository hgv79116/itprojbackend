        "<p>Students undertake more complex assessment, documentation and conservation actions across different material and media types within an ethical and sustainable decision making framework. Content, processes and actions will depend on the values and functionality of the cultural and heritage collections but will include examination, documentation, digital and physical interventions.</p>",
        "<p>This subject will be offered twice: one intensive for paper and painting specialties, and the other intensive for object-based specialties.  It includes individual or group projects in either the conservation laboratory at the Grimwade Centre for Cultural Materials Conservation with in the field, or off campus conservation treatments.</p>",
        "<p>During the pre-teaching period students are expected to participate in a 1-hour online orientation forum, engage with the online lectures, complete the course readings, quizzes and any other course preparation as outlined in the LMS. The LMS will be available at the commencement of the pre-teaching period.</p>"
