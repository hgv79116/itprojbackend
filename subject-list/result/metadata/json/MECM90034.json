    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides an advanced understanding of the contemporary global marketing communications environment. It traces the emergence of the new generation of global media platforms since the 1980s, and examines the growing structural integration of advertising, marketing and public relations firms over this period as a result of this. Through case studies of global marketing campaigns and global brands, it demonstrates the extent to which global marketers must continue to negotiate different cultural and regulatory settings within the media, underlining the continuing importance of national and regional contexts in a global environment.</p>"
