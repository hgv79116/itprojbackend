        "<p>Wellbeing Leadership examines why creating wellbeing cultures in diverse contexts such as in organisations, communities and sporting groups has become essential. The role of leaders to navigate and organise change with wellbeing in mind and to implement clear and intentional processes, will be critically examined. The different approaches leaders adopt to foster sustained wellbeing will be explored from a wide range of disciplinary perspectives, with a focus on systems thinking and evidence-based practices. Students will reflect on the complexities of leadership and the nuances of ethical practice in building a culture of wellbeing.</p>"
