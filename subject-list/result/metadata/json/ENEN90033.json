    "overview": [
        "<p><strong>AIMS</strong><br/><br/>This subject provides the application of principles of solar energy engineering. A number of solar technologies and applications methods are investigated.<br/><br/>This subject uses a project based learning where students work in teams to design a solar system for a particular application considering environmental, social and financial constraints. Students learn to apply the principles of solar energy and design.<br/><br/>Knowledge gained in this subject will allow graduates to practice in the area of renewable energy industry. The subject complements other subjects offered in the energy theme of the Department such as Energy for Sustainable Development and Sustainable Infrastructure Engineering.<br/><br/><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT</strong></p>",
