        "<p>This subject draws on empirical psychology, philosophy and law to explore practical ways of reasoning through the complex moral challenges that face us in our private lives as well as in our professional roles and in our roles as responsible global citizens.</p>",
        "<p>We will explore how people should and do reason about pressing contemporary issues including creating a moral self in the absence of authoritative moral guidance, navigating a social world consisting of diverse identities, and being a responsible, law\u2010abiding citizen in a global order in which issues such as climate change, technology, AI and mass migration pose complex and novel ethical dilemmas. We will explore answers to the question \u201chow should one live\u201d by drawing on scientific evidence from psychology, thought experiments and arguments from philosophy and illustrative cases from law and professional ethics.</p>"
