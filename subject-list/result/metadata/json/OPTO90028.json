    "overview": [
        "<p>Note: This subject is only available to students enrolled in the Doctor of Optometry.</p>",
        "<p>In this subject, students will integrate the optometric knowledge gained during their first three years of study with clinical work in a variety of clinical settings, in a way that will consolidate what they have learned and help them develop and improve the clinical skills necessary to practice optometry and serve patients in a safe and satisfactory way. The variety of clinical settings may include clinical rotations based in the University of Melbourne teaching clinics, public and private metropolitan practices, and hospital clinics. Other possible rotations include overseas placement sites, rural settings and specialist practices. Students will have the opportunity to gain experience in the areas of contact lenses, paediatrics, ocular disease, clinical therapeutic management of disease, low vision and binocular vision clinical areas during the year.</p>"
