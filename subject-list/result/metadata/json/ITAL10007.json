        "<p>Students continue to focus both practically and reflectively on Italian texts through reading and listening as a vehicle to contextually deepen their knowledge of contemporary Italian language and culture. Through the major theatre project and the weekly reading of contemporary Italian short stories, along with a series of dedicated lectures and tutorials, students also explore aspects of contemporary Italian literature, society and history. These themes will be explored further through an online virtual exchange with students in Italy. This subject assists students to develop a critical capacity enabling them to understand and analyse a variety of text types (film, music, mass media, literature, etc.). Students will also focus on specific language aspects, such as phonology, as a means to broaden their appreciation of the Italian language and develop an arsenal of diverse tools to strengthen their language learning.</p>"
