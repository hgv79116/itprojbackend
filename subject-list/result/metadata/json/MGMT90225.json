    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject discusses the business model as the mechanism used by entrepreneurs to deliver value to their selected target markets, as well as the method by which entrepreneurs capture value. This is a dynamic process that underpins the commercialisation of innovation. This subject has a detailed and advanced examination of the challenges of designing and implementing a business model., the skills, resources and relationships needed to manage activities like designing customer value propositions, protecting intellectual property and potentially pivoting, and the strategic execution capabilities that can lead to the creation of successful business model. The subject also considers the way that emerging concepts like shared value can be incorporated into a business model. This is done though comparative analysis of competitors who use different but equally successful business models, as well as considering applications where business models have failed. The subject also examines metrics for assessing the ongoing health of the business model, as well as business models as a form of innovation in their own right, not just a vehicle for entrepreneurship.</p>"
