        "<p>This subject is an introduction to Economic Design and the interaction of modern economic theory, economic policy and experimental economics. The subject will cover mechanism design, auction theory, contract theory, and the fundamental results on the limits to efficiency in asymmetric information environments. The theory will be illustrated with case studies of recent policy applications of economic design techniques.</p>"
