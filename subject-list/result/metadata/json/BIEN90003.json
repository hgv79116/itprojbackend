        "<p><strong>AIMS</strong></p>",
        "<p>Candidates will undertake as individuals a high level investigative research project which could involve a critical literature review, experimental research and/or development, theoretical modelling, process simulation and/or the solution of an industrial problem. Rigorous planning and scheduling of the project, time management, technical communication, interpretation of results and team work will be required. Lectures will be presented on Laboratory safety, and the use of statistical methods for experimental data analysis.</p>",
        "<p>This subject is designed for students who have demonstrated an ability to undertake a research project to a high standard and who wish to continue and extend the project to another semester. The subject is well-suited to students intending to undertake a research higher degree on completion of their Masters program.</p>",
        "<p> </p>",
        "<p><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT</strong></p>",
        "<p>The exact content covered in the subject will depend to some extent on the nature of the research project. Topics covered will most probably include literature searches, laboratory safety, risk assessment, data modelling, data analysis, error analysis and report writing.</p>",
        "<p>This subject has been integrated with the Skills Towards Employment Program (STEP) and contains activities that can assist in the completion of the Engineering Practice Hurdle (EPH).</p>"
