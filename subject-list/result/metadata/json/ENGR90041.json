Each project is carried out under the supervision of a member of academic staff and where appropriate, an industry partner.</p>",
        "<p>The emphasis of the project is associated with a problem formulation that will require an explorative approach, where students will pursue outcomes associated with new knowledge or understanding, within the engineering science disciplines, often as an adjunct to existing academic research initiatives.</p>",
        "<p>It is expected that the Engineering Research Project will incorporate findings associated with both well-defined professional practice and research principles and will provide students with the opportunity to integrate technical knowledge and generic skills gained in earlier years.</p>"
