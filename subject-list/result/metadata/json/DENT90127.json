    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will be conducted as a pre-clinical laboratory subject building further practical skills to prepare students for dental clinical practice. Students will apply knowledge of minimal intervention dentistry, dental materials commonly used for direct restorative procedures and the instrumentation utilised for surgical management of dental caries. They will similarly apply knowledge of anatomy and equipment to periodontal instrumentation.</p>",
        "<p>Students will engage in pre-clinical tasks on manikins to develop skills in: surgical management of dental caries including &gt;more extensive caries lesions and the process of restoration of lost tooth structure and; periodontal debridement. Students will learn about correct posture in the dental operatory and working in a team (dental assistant and the operator) to debride teeth and prepare and restore teeth in a clinical simulation setting.</p>"
