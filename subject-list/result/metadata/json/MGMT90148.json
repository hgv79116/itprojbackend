    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will critically explore the purpose and value of consulting as a practice and as a profession. Through tracing the consulting lifecycle and the examination of client-consultant relationships, students will learn to emulate the requisite soft and technical skills of effective consultants and develop an understanding of what it means to be an external change agent. Using a case-based approach, this subject will introduce various consulting frameworks and tools used to diagnose, analyse and solve complex but seemingly common organisational problems. In the process, students will gain a firm appreciation of the art and science of professional consulting and learn to apply problem-solving approaches that balance methodological rigour with creativity and lateral thinking.</p>"
