    "overview": [
        "<p>Complex data consisting of dependent measurements collected at different times and locations are increasingly important in a wide range of disciplines, including environmental sciences, biomedical sciences, engineering and economics. This subject will introduce you to advanced statistical methods and probability models that have been developed to address complex data structures, such as functional data, geo-statistical data, lattice data, and point process data. A unifying theme of this subject will be the development of inference, classification and prediction methods able to cope with the dependencies that often arise in these data.</p>"
