        "<p><strong>AIMS</strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject provides an in-depth coverage of transistor (MOSFET and BJT) devices and their use in common circuits. In particular, students will study topics including: transistor operating modes and switching; principles of CMOS circuits; transistor biasing; current-source/emitter-amplifiers; low-frequency response; followers; class B amplifiers; current limiting; current sources and mirrors; differential pairs; feedback in amplifiers and stability; operational amplifiers; operational amplifier circuits; and voltage regulation. This material will be complemented by exposure to circuit simulation software tools and the opportunity to further develop circuit construction/test skills in the laboratory.<strong><br/><br/>INDICATIVE CONTENT<br/></strong></p>",
        "<p>Design-focused field-effect and bipolar elementary transistor models, and design of elementary amplifier stages and biasing circuits. Static and dynamic behaviour of amplifier circuits including frequency response, feedback and stability, slew-rate and clipping. Operational amplifiers and opamp based circuits; voltage regulators, references and voltage converters. Verification of electronic circuits using simulation.</p>"
