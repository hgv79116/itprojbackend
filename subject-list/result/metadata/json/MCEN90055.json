    "overview": [
        "<p>Over the history of industrialisation, the manufacturing industry has developed and deployed a diversity of manufacturing processes and technologies to fulfil ever-increasing demands from society for products and service. The aim of this subject is to provide students with the capacity to understand conventional and advanced manufacturing processes, as well as the ability to determine appropriate process pathways of processes for producing specific products.</p>",
        "<p>This course consists of three main modules: 1) Fundamentals of manufacturing, materials and testing methods; 2) Conventional manufacturing processes and technology (e.g. machining, casting, forming and joining);3) Advanced manufacturing processes and technology (e.g. advanced machining, additive manufacturing, surface technology, micro and nano fabrication technology). This subject has a series of laboratory exercises that provide hands-on experience with manufacturing in real-life scenarios.</p>"
