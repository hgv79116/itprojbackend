        "<p>Bioinformatics involves the analysis of biological data and randomness is inherent in both the biological processes themselves and the sampling mechanisms by which they are observed. This subject first introduces stochastic processes and their applications in Bioinformatics, including evolutionary models. It then considers the application of classical statistical methods including estimation, hypothesis testing, model selection, multiple comparisons, and multivariate statistical techniques in Bioinformatics.</p>"
