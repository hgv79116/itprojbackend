        "<p>This subject will be a combination of both of advanced theoretical principles and clinical application of learning to critical care nursing in practice. Students will demonstrate the ability to undertake and support comprehensive patient assessment, monitoring, evaluation and care planning in specialty nursing practice. Upon successful completion of the subject, students will incorporate and apply scientific knowledge, evidence-based treatment and nursing interventions to support a patient-centred approach and inform their clinical decision making in practice.</p>"
