    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject explores the content and pedagogical content knowledge needed to teach <em>Number</em> in the <em>Number and Algebra</em> strand in Years 7-10 Mathematics, including <em>number and place value</em>, <em>fractions</em>, <em>decimals</em>, <em>real numbers</em>,<em> money and financial arithmetic</em>. The role of multiplicative reasoning in both <em>Number</em> and across the curriculum will be emphasised. Current challenges, issues and opportunities in teaching <em>Number </em>will be addressed.</p>",
        "<p>Participants will study research on students\u2019 mathematical understanding and effective teaching methods. Methods of identifying learners\u2019 special needs and differentiating teaching will be a focus. Research and practice on promoting conceptual change through cognitive conflict and targeted discussion will be reviewed. Development of the proficiencies of fluency, understanding, reasoning and problem solving will be considered in the context of <em>Number</em>. Practical teaching tasks will complement theory.</p>"
