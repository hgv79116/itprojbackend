        "<p>This subject uses case studies to build student competencies in working with complex, multifaceted clinical cases. The content will focus on a range of issues across the lifespan including, diverse cultural backgrounds, mental health, behavioural difficulties, and neurological issues. Students will be required to integrate information from a variety of sources and use evidence-based practice to establish and implement client-focused intervention and education programs. Students will also need to address professional issues and communicate their ideas clearly and effectively in both written and oral format.</p>"
