    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces state-of-the-art computational techniques that benefit research in microeconomics, macroeconomics, econometrics, data administration and analysis. Students will learn to solve and estimate structural economic models and to apply these methods to substantive issues in various areas such as econometrics, industrial organisation, labour economics, economic history, and macroeconomics. Students will also learn how to handle spatial datasets for causal inference and undertake empirical analyses through efficient programming and probabilistic modelling. The course emphasises both theoretical knowledge of computational methods and practical skills.</p>"
