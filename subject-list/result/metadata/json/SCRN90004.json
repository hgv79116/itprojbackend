    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will introduce students to a range of organisations whose functions encompass the promotion, collection and presentation of contemporary visual culture. This is an industry-focussed subject where representatives of local and national arts organisations offer students direct insight into their role and strategic direction. Representatives will include directors and executives from various industry bodies including government agencies, state institutions, regional organisations, contemporary spaces, commercial entities and professional associations (such as Australia Council, Arts Victoria, the National Gallery of Victoria, the Australian Centre for the Moving Image, the Museum of Victoria, Australian Centre for Contemporary Art, the Melbourne International Film Festival, Village Roadshow, Sotheby\u2019s Australia, Gertrude Contemporary Art Spaces and Cinema Nova, among others). Students will study the history and development of these industry bodies as well as their social and cultural impact. They will explore such areas as governance, funding, sponsorship, philanthropy, policy formation, administration, collecting, curating, programming and audience research. Emphasis will be on the aims and goals of these bodies, the extent to which they fulfil community needs and the degree to which they promote the arts. External constraints such as censorship, government policy and community response will also be considered.</p>"
