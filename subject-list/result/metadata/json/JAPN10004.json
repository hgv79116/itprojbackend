    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is for students who have completed Japanese 5 or those who have basic language skills and knowledge of Japan and can recognise around 500 kanji characters, or those who have equivalent experience in Japanese. This subject provides a preparation for students to engage in academic research using Japanese. It aims to further develop students\u2019 Japanese communication skills through discussions and task-based collaborative work. Students will critically examine issues and phenomena prevalent in Japan from various perspectives. Students will have further exposure to various Japanese essays in different genres (e.g., survey reports, essays of critical and or analytical nature) to understand differences in their rhetorical structures. The subject covers wide ranging topics about Japan but they will be examined in global perspectives.</p>",
        "<p>Students will also have the opportunity to practise variations of spoken Japanese by applying Japanese honorific system rules to the situation, depending on the relationship between the participants of the conversations. Through class activities, such as discussions and a small research project, students will build further vocabulary and expressions, including around 150 additional kanji characters. In addition, students will further develop intercultural and interpersonal skills to create rapport to achieve positive outcomes.</p>"
