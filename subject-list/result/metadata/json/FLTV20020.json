    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is an intensive two-week international study experience, through which students will gain a deeper understanding of contemporary screen business and culture at the highest level. Students will be challenged to think beyond the limitations of their current screen practice by visiting a significant international film festival and participating in events / screenings showcasing current and emerging practice and in the screen industry. International Film Festival Studio provides students the opportunity to experience study in the context of another culture and to consider their own screen work within the framework of the international film market and culture. Students will generate new work on the trip which will be screened / presented upon return to Melbourne.</p>"
