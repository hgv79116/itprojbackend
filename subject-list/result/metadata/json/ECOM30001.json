    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject examines multiple regression analysis and its use in economics, management, finance, accounting and marketing. Topics will include the properties of estimators, hypothesis testing, specification error, multicollinearity, dummy variables, heteroskedasticity, serial correlation, panel data and methods for discrete dependent variables. These methods are consolidated through a Capstone project involving hypothesis-formation, real-world data collection and writing-up the results in a formal report.</p>"

        "Use computer software to perform simple data descriptions and to graph relationships between variables, to estimate econometric models using OLS and Instrumental Variables, and to estimate simple dynamic models",
        "Apply econometric methods to real world data and perform diagnostic testing to ensure the model is adequately specified",
        "Formulate hypotheses about economic phenomena, collect real-world data, apply econometric methods to test hypotheses, and draw evidenced-based conclusions or implications for economic theory and/or public policy"
