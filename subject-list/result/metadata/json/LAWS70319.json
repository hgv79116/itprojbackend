        "<p>All governments need robust tax systems capable of funding them. Modern tax systems have also taken on other public policy roles, in income distribution and economic activity, and become integral to governments\u2019 social and economic policies. Tax policy design thus entails a challenging mix of economic, social, legal, accounting and administrative policies - which has become more complex in a world of increasingly mobile capital and labour.</p>",

The subject will analyse the available tax bases, the interactions between the tax and transfer systems and issues of tax law design and administration.</p>",
