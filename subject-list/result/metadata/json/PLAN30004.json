        "<p>Transit Oriented Development is one of the two subjects that define the Transport Design Specilisation in the Bachelor Design.</p>",
        "<p>The subject will examine the relationship between transport planning and urban design in diverse urban, Australian and international contexts. Transport Oriented Design will investigate contemporary practices and policies of efficient integration between transport planning and design that delivers human health, ecological sustainability and social equity outcomes. It will combine skills in design innovation and spatial analysis to deliver a learning platform supporting the study of transportation issues in an interdisciplinary environment. </p>",
        "<p>The subject will be delivered in studio form with readings, lectures, guest lectures and field trips.</p>"
