    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject develops the technical, creative and performance skills needed to become an individual and versatile dance artist.</p>",
        "<p>Students explore their movement potential through a variety of approaches and are encouraged to take ownership of their training through scheduling rehearsals, research and workshops.</p>",
        "<p>Working independently, with a partner or within a group, they explore, investigate and interrogate dance principles. Energy-work and movement intention are of central importance for a dancer\u2019s presence onstage and are a core focus.</p>",
        "<p>Training in performance skills to develop an energetic and clear body, are entwined with technical skills and the application of movement imagery.</p>",
        "<p>Structural integration, together with skills in how to visually and emotionally interpret movements, facilitates an interplay between action and meaning. Working at this level involves challenges to movement memory through the inhabiting of more demanding movement sequences, scores and improvisational processes.</p>",
        "<p>Classes will include experimentation with the creative and performative potential of class material. Students are encouraged to work in greater depth, employing complex problem-solving and evolving strong understanding of dance techniques including contemporary, indigenous and ballet.</p>",
        "<p>Teaching and learning also emphasises fundamental social values including respecting and acknowledging others and being responsive and responsible as group participants in a class setting.</p>",
        "<p>This subject is underpinned by a complementary programme of body conditioning and dance fitness training.</p>"
