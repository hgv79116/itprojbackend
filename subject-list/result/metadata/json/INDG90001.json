    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will examine the diversity of protocols and management practices that arts and cultural managers need to be cognisant of when working in Australian Indigenous cultural contexts. Examining management concerns and practices across a range of art forms in both urban and remote settings, this subject assists in preparing arts and cultural managers to work with Indigenous artists and arts communities. The subject will present a contemporary overview of the significance of arts in Australian Indigenous social history and explore the nature of indigenous protocols, Indigenous cultural and intellectual property rights, the role of criticism in the development of Australian Indigenous arts and the practice of management in the Australian Indigenous cultural contexts.</p>"
