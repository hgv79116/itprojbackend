        "<p>In this capstone subject, students will lead a creative team in the realisation of a substantive short screen work.</p>",
        "<p>Students will prepare, re-draft, analyse and finalise the screen idea they developed in Screen Story 2. Through the lens of their chosen screen production role, students will engage vital re-drafting, story analysis and story pitching skills to refine both their individual production roles and responsibilities in bringing those screen ideas to fruition.\u202f\u202f</p>",
        "<p>Students will further develop organisational and technical skills in filmmaking by engaging in multiple creative and managerial production and post-production roles. This subject allows students to discover their own strengths while recognising the essential skills brought by those they collaborate with.</p>",
        "<p>Students will build teams that reflect the creative and practical need of the project and take charge of the implementation of the many creative, practical, and collaborative skills learned in the course to date. This subject encourages each student to develop and extend their own skill set while understanding how they influence and affect the collaborative environment so essential to realising screen story. </p>",
        "<p>The screen work should achieve full industry and university and/or best practice compliance, including effectively planning, executing, and delivering a film to budget and to schedule, indulging deep creative engagement, collaborative partnerships, artistic nuance and thematic relevance.</p>",
        "<p>Students have an option to raise funds to support their capstone project. They will be expected to work respectfully with industry, community, and university stakeholders to see their projects to fruition.\u202f</p>"
