        "<p>This subject is part of a sequence that together constitute the 75-point research project offered through the Bachelor of Science (Degree with Honours) stream in BioSciences.</p>",
        "<p>The subject involves laboratory or field-based experimental research in an area of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Genetics, Genomics and Developmental Biology, or Plant Biology. The research projects cover a broad range of research from molecular to population and evolutionary biology in micro-organisms, insects, plants and animals.</p>",
        "<p>The project will be based in the laboratory of an academic staff member in the School of BioSciences or an approved external supervisor, depending on the particular research project. The research project aims to develop a range of experimental and technical skills, a capacity to set goals and to design and plan experiments.</p>",
        "<p>Apart from the help and guidance from their supervisor(s) each student also has a committee, which provides additional help and expertise, including advice on design of the research project. This committee and supervisor(s) are responsible for assessment of the research project subject. The subject also provides students with skills and knowledge for understanding original research and enhanced written and oral communication skills.</p>",
        "<p>The subject involves experimental research under the direction of a supervisor.</p>"
