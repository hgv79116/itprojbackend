        "<p>Intellectual property is an increasingly contested field \u2013 both nationally and internationally. Different states\u2019 intellectual property laws manifest different attitudes towards the defining policy tension in this field of law: how to encourage and reward innovative activity, while ensuring that intellectual property does not raise intolerable barriers to market entry or impede fundamental rights and freedoms. This subject provides an overview of key United States intellectual property doctrines, statutes and principles, and will help students understand some of the ways the United States addresses these issues through its intellectual property laws. Before taking up his joint positions of Professor of Law at Melbourne Law School and Chair in Private Law at Victoria University, Professor Austin directed the intellectual property program at the University of Arizona College of Law.</p>",
