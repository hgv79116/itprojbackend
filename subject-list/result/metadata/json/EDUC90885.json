    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will provide foundational conceptual frameworks for understanding learning and teaching necessary to Teacher Candidates\u2019 development as Clinical Practitioners. It will examine how learning can be understood and enhanced from a range of evidence-based, theoretical perspectives. Candidates will gain knowledge and understanding of physical, social and intellectual development and characteristics of students and how these may affect learning. Specifically pedagogical practices focusing on understanding how learning occurs and the processes that facilitate classroom learning will be identified. This subject will also support Teacher Candidates\u2019 explorations of classroom management practices and strategies that support students\u2019 wellbeing and safety to provide high-quality learning environments that meet school and/or system, curriculum and legislative requirements. It will equip Teacher Candidates with the fundamental skills necessary to begin to observe, design and implement whole classroom approaches to inclusion. This subject will introduce the Clinical Teaching Cycle as a primary approach to teacher practice that positions assessment as a key underpinning to teachers\u2019 instructional planning using the collection and interpretation of valid evidence. Examples of various conceptualisations and purposes of assessment will be used to develop deep understandings of methods of evidence collection and interpretation. The theme of this core subject is \u2018planning and evidence\u2019.</p>"
