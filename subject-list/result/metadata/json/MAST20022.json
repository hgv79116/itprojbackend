    "overview": [
        "<p class=\"SSPBodyText\">This subject introduces the theory of groups, which is at the core of modern algebra, and which has applications in many parts of mathematics, chemistry, computer science and theoretical physics. It also develops the theory of linear algebra, building on material in earlier subjects and providing both a basis for later mathematics studies and an introduction to topics that have important applications in science and technology.</p>",
        "<p class=\"SSPBodyText\">Topics include: modular arithmetic and RSA cryptography; abstract groups, homomorphisms, normal subgroups, quotient groups, group actions, symmetry groups, permutation groups and matrix groups; theory of general vector spaces, inner products, linear transformations, spectral theorem for normal matrices, Jordan normal form.</p>"
