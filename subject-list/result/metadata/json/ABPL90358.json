    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject critically reviews established and emerging research areas in the field of construction. This is accompanied by an exposition of the underlying research objectives, the methods in use or required, and the challenges and limitations of the methods.</p>",
        "<p>Designed as an advanced, hands-on introduction to the culture and protocols of disciplinary research in construction, the subject has two aims: 1) To equip students with the skills necessary to conduct rigorous and original research; 2) To provide them with an opportunity to develop a scholarly foundation and a theoretical framework for an investigation of their choice.</p>",
        "<p>The subject concentrates on the preliminary stages of research, from defining a research question through to planning and commencing the research. The product of their work constitutes the basis for original empirical research project conducted in ABPL90359 Research Practicum in Construction and forms an integral part of the final research report of that subject.</p>"
