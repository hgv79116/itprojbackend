        "<p>How should we understand politics in the Middle East and South Asia\u2014two regions known for political events that shape the wider world? This subject uses detailed case studies to explore fundamental questions regarding religion and politics in Muslim-majority as well    as Muslim-minority states. Particular attention is paid to the relationship between Islam and violent resistance (including revolution) as well as electoral politics, constitutionalism, and human rights.</p>",
        "<p>To facilitate discussion, the subject examines primary source materials such as constitutions, manifestos, charters, and first-hand reports that illuminate how states and organizations with a religious orientation articulate their <em>own</em> political views in Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India, with concluding references to transnational links in Europe, East Asia, and Australia.</p>"
