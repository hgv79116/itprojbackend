    "overview": [
        "<p>Leading ideas in contemporary education are introduced and critically examined. Concepts explored include intentional teaching, 21st century learning, transnational education, powerful knowledge, power and knowledge, educational privilege and equity and social identity. These concepts are set within the fields of curriculum, pedagogy, assessment, policy and governance and current debates within these fields. A critical examination of the key concepts is made by juxtaposing local, national and global perspectives and demonstrating how these concepts are taken up in existing research projects. Students will draw on their own professional and educational experiences to investigate ideas and their application to practice. Negotiated, integrated learning via theory, case studies, simulation exercises and work based projects will then be developed.</p>"
