    "overview": [
        "<p>Issues concerning children, whether they arise at the international, regional or local level, are increasingly being examined from a human rights perspective. Much of the momentum for this movement has been generated by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1989, and has been ratified by every state in the world except the United States and South Sudan. This subject is designed to provide students with an understanding of the CRC and the idea of a human rights-based approach to matters involving children. It will be of interest to anyone who works in areas that impact on children, either directly or indirectly, at the international, regional or local level. The lecturer has extensive networks with civil society, international bodies and government agencies that he draws on to provide an appropriate blend of academic and practical content.</p>",
        "<p>The subject consists of two parts. Part one involves a general discussion of:</p>",
        "<ul><li>The notion of children\u2019s rights</li><li>The international framework for the protection of children\u2019s rights, with particular emphasis on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child</li><li>The factors that impact on the implementation of the Convention, both in Australia and overseas.</li></ul>",
        "<p>Part two involves an examination of specific issues relevant to children and how the Convention and a rights-based analysis can be used to respond to these issues. The issues will be drawn from areas such as:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Sexual exploitation, including trafficking, prostitution and pornography</li><li>Child labour</li><li>Juvenile justice</li><li>Child refugees</li><li>Violence against children</li><li>Children in armed conflict</li><li>HIV/AIDS and children</li><li>Child poverty and homelessness.</li></ul>"
