        "<p><span>This is the final subject in the MBA, and it asks to students to look both backwards and forwards. In looking backwards, students reflect on their journey through the MBA. This backward reflection is designed to help students consolidate key learnings from throughout the MBA program, creating a holistic perspective of what is required to be an effective manager. In looking forwards, students reflect on the personal and professional life to which they aspire. This forward reflection is designed to help students prepare to effectively map and manage their career within the larger context of their life choices. As part of this forward reflection, students will be equipped with tools to help them manage and navigate their career. </span></p>"
