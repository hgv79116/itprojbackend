It can be hard to see them clearly through all the politics; our aim in this course is to set the politics aside and think carefully through the philosophical issues. In this course we\u2019ll work through obligations to co-nationals, states\u2019 right to exclude, the relationship of global poverty and migration, refugee status and refugee markets, whether the poor may secure their rights to subsistence by force, temporary migration, family reunification, offshore processing, and denaturalization.</p>"
