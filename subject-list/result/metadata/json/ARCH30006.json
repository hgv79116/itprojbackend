        "<p>Informed by the <a href=\"https://www.theicod.org/storage/app/media/resources/International_IDC_book_small_web.pdf\">International and Australian Indigenous Design Charter</a>, this subject exposes students to First Peoples perspectives and introduces approaches for engaging with First Peoples communities and designing with Country.</p>",
        "<p>You will study examples of inclusive design practices that seek to respond to First Peoples and Traditional Custodian community and cultural needs and aspirations.  This subject starts with a place-based focus on the Kulin Nation and Naarm (Melbourne), builds on collaborative partnerships with Traditional Owner Groups (Wurundjeri/Yorta Yorta/Olkola etc this will change from year to year to share cultural load), and examines global examples of First Peoples cultures and First Peoples -led design projects, to explore ethically and culturally safe protocols and layers of working with and for First Peoples communities.</p>",
        "<p>The subject will explore historical and contemporary First Peoples design practices with a focus on principles and protocols for engaging with First Peoples knowledges, communities, sites of significance and artefacts. Drawing on global, historical and contemporary precedents as expressed in key texts and concepts, the subject unfolds through the consideration of design through a mapping exercise that develops students\u2019 capacity to respectfully  engage with First Peoples Knowledges, sites, materials and associated stories, and to do so with purpose and with reciprocity. An emphasis on First Peoples design concerning cultural landscapes, artefacts, and stories will enable students to value First Peoples knowledges as applicable to contemporary design, and environmental and societal challenges.</p>",
        "<p>The course will equip students with current strength-based approaches to design that are inclusive of First Peoples aspirations for change and transformation in landscapes and the built environment.</p>",
        "<p>In small groups throughout the semester, students will explore First Peoples informed, First Peoples co-created, First Peoples led and First Peoples designed precedents and approaches. Students will generate initial site and project based design ideas, and associated cultural protocols for as identified by Traditional Owner and or First Nations partners.</p>"
