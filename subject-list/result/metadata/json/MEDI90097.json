        "<p>In this subject, students will gain a detailed understanding of all aspect of the drug development pipeline, beginning from the basic science research that triggers investigation of a new therapeutic strategy, through pre-clinical and clinical testing and final introduction to the general market. It will also cover practical issues such as funding considerations and the regulatory frameworks that exist  to ensure patient safety and eventual medication approval.  The design and methodology utilised in international drug discovery initiatives will be utilised to illustrate previously successful approaches.</p>"
