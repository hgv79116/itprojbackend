    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will describe the fundamental characteristics of a genome, its structure and how genetic information contained within the genome is expressed and transmitted. The subject will integrate the molecular basis of genetic variation with the principles of Mendelian, quantitative and population genetics to explain patterns of genetic variation. A core aspect of this subject will be the development of analytical skills associated with solving genetic-based problems and interpreting data from genetic experiments.</p>"
