    "overview": [
        "<p>This is a compulsory subject in the Master of Applied Psychology. Qualitative research plays an integral role across a range of applied settings by providing rich and detailed descriptions of human behaviour in which contexts in which it occurs. Use of qualitative methods enables researchers to explore meanings of phenomena to generate theories and hypotheses that may be used to guide processes such as design and evaluation. In contemporary applied settings qualitative and quantitative research are often combined in mixed methods designs to provide robust and rich evidence.</p>",
        "<p>This subject will introduce students to qualitative research in psychology with a focus on its application in real world settings. Students will learn the theory and assumptions of qualitative inquiry and how these guide research design, choice of methods and analytical approach. Students will be introduced to established qualitative methods used with human participants such as interviews, focus groups and observations, as well as evolving methods for exploring digital data. Students will work in small groups to design and conduct a project of their choice to build practical skills in qualitative methods.</p>"
