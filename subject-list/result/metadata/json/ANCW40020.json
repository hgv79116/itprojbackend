    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject involves the completion of an 80-100 hours work placement that integrates academic and professional skills, and will result in an improved knowledge of organisations, workplace culture and career pathways in Ancient World Studies. The placement is preceded by several pre-placement classes that are designed to introduce skills for developing, identifying, and articulating employability skills and attributes and linking them to employer requirements as well as giving students an insight into appropriate workplace behaviours. During a post-placement group seminar enrolled students will reflect on their internship experience specifically and the connections between their education and work placement learning more broadly.</p>",
        "<p>Internships are available with a wide range of partners in secondary education, cultural materials conservation, museum, cultural heritage, and archaeological consulting sectors. Enrolled students will be able to select three internship preferences from which one will be allocated to them.  </p>"
