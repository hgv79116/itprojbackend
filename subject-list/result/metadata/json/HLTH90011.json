    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject offers students the opportunity to design an original research project with academic supervision. The preparation for this subject starts in Semester 1 through the HLTH90014 Healthcare Research: Principles and Designs course. Students are encouraged to collaborate with a research supervisor to develop their own research project and complete any required Human Research Ethics applications. The chosen topics can align with students' personal interests or be relevant to ongoing research in clinical genetics or other healthcare services. </p>",
        "<p>The subject comprises a combination of face-to-face and online seminars, as well as regular meetings with research supervisors. Students will also have access to additional resources and upskilling opportunities provided by the University of Melbourne. </p>"
