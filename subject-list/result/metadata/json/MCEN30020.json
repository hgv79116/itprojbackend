        "<p>This subject will cover the modelling of a range of physical systems across multiple domains as ordinary differential equations, and then introduce the mathematical techniques to analyse their open loop behaviour.</p>",
        "<p>Topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Development of low order models of a range of electrical, thermal, mechanical, pneumatic and hydraulic dynamic systems</li><li>Different representations of these systems (time and, frequency domains) and transformations between them (Laplace, Fourier and Z-transforms)</li><li>Representations of systems \u2013 transfer functions, Bode plots, state space, block diagrams, etc</li><li>Identification of linear time invariant systems (least squares identification)</li><li>Relation to time domain properties of open loop responses \u2013 stability, oscillations, etc.</li></ul>",
        "<p>MATLAB will be used throughout the course to complement the presented concepts.</p>",
