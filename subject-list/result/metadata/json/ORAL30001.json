        "<p>Oral Health Therapy Research is a yearlong final year subject within the Bachelor of Oral Health program. In this subject, students will work on a research area, of their choice, relevant to the field of oral health therapy. Students will undertake a literature review, formulate research questions or hypotheses, and develop a research proposal, applying the principles of research methodology and evidence-based practice to address their identified research problem. Students will learn how health policy and health sociology can influence oral health therapy research and practice. They will develop skills in oral and written communication, and in team-based and interprofessional practice.</p>",
        "<p>Students will be assigned to research groups, to enable peer support and collaboration with students researching similar topics. Each group will be appointed a research supervisor who will support them in the development of their individual research proposal.</p>",
