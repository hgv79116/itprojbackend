    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides students with advanced understanding of global and international media communication in the recent past and the contemporary world. The subject will encourage students to engage with empirical case study materials concerning key aspects of global media performance, industries, texts and audiences and their contribution to wider processes of transformation and change: economic, political, social, cultural. Developments in contemporary media theory and methodologies deployed in the analysis of global media will be addressed throughout. As well as providing a coherent overview of past research and theoretical trajectories in respect of international and global communications, the subject will also equip students to engage with current debates centring on questions of globalisation/localisation, identity and citizenship and such media approaches as \"public sphere(s)\".</p>"
