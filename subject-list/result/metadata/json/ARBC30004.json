    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject offers students the opportunity to learn, internalise and activate more sophisticated aspects of Arabic morphology and syntax and to develop a deeper analytical understanding of the language. This will be achieved through interacting with a variety of written and spoken texts ranging from travellers\u2019 accounts to biographical pieces, evaluative and analytical articles to interviews and short lectures. These will allow students to further their understanding of the history of the Middle East, Islam and Muslim society, as well as modern educational and social trends and movements emerging in the region.</p>",
        "<p>Conversations and discussions will provide opportunities to express one\u2019s own opinions and feelings on topics of cultural, social and political nature. Written expression will be developed through the preparation of resumes, summaries, complex narratives, descriptive, informative and evaluative pieces, and students will be able to engage in the creative process of producing analytical/critical writing of their own.</p>"
