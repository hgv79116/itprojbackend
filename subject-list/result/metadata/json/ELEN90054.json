        "<p><strong>AIMS <br/></strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject provides an introduction to probability theory, random variables, random vectors, decision tests, and stochastic processes. Uncertainty is inevitable in real engineering systems, and the laws of probability offer a powerful way to evaluate uncertainty, to predict and to make decisions according to well-defined, quantitative principles. The material covered is important in fields such as communications, data networks, signal processing and electronics. This subject is a core requirement in the Master of Engineering (Electrical, Mechanical and Mechatronics).<strong> <br/><br/>INDICATIVE CONTENT<br/></strong></p>",
