        "<p>This subject builds on the student's knowledge in radiology, particularly as it applies to the neuro-musculo-skeletal system. The student will be able to explore normal and pathological findings as displayed by a variety of imaging modalities including x-ray, CT scans, MRI and US imaging. They will also have a better appreciation of when to use imaging, which imaging modality to use and when onward referral to another clinician may be more appropriate.</p>"
