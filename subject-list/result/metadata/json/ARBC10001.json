        "<p>The various audio-visual activities, accessed through the course DVDs, the LMS program and the Internet, will further develop students\u2019 listening comprehension and help maintain and augment existing knowledge of vocabulary and structures. Knowledge gained through developing reading and listening skills will be conducive to activating vocabulary and structures, and students will be able to see their progress through the varied writing and speaking activities offering plenty of opportunities for communication.</p>"
