        "<p>Students enrolled in this subject will complete an internship of a minimum of 20 days  full-time placement with an external organisation in the architectural, urban and cultural heritage field. Students will be supervised by the Subject Coordinator in collaboration with a designated party at the host organisation. They will work across a range of tasks relevant to the organisation's objectives, and will develop and complete a specific project in discussion with the host organisation and the Subject Coordinator. The Internship experience will enable students to extend and apply the knowledge acquired through the MUCH coursework subjects, will provide students with a valuable professional experience, and will extend their professional networks. The internship will facilitate the application of knowledge acquired through coursework to a professional workplace.</p>",
