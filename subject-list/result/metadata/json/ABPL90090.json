    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject explores skills required for transport planners who wish to improve the economic, environmental and social performance of urban transport systems. It draws on international experience and research to articulate the principles and practical techniques in two key areas:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Public transport planning and network design; and</li><li>The preparation of regional multi-modal transport plans.</li></ul>",
        "<p>This subject includes a half-day field trip involving use of public transport services in a chosen suburban region of Melbourne. This trip will be undertaken in small groups in week 3 and is a hurdle requirement. Students will require a valid Myki card, and the cost will not exceed a daily ticket in Zone 1.</p>"
