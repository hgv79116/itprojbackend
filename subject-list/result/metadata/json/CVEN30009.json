        "<p><span>This subject introduces the basic methods of structural analysis and the design of simple structures which are built of reinforced concrete, steel, timber and masonry. A feature of this subject is the integration of the design and analytical skills in dealing with contemporary structures that have an effective blending of materials for achieving satisfactory performance and economy in construction.</span></p>",
        "<p><span>This subject consolidates basic structural theory and design abilities that underpin further specialised studies in structural design in engineering masters programs. It also gives students some basic capabilities to seek work experience in the engineering profession.<br/><br/></span></p>",
        "<p><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT</strong><br/><br/><span>Topics covered include: stress analysis in beams, deflection calculations using direct integration and virtual work methods, structural analyses of beams and frames by the force method, structural design of reinforced concrete beams and columns, design of pad footing, structural design of steel beams, columns and ties, design of timber joists and masonry squat walls.</span> <br/><br/></p>"
