        "<p class=\"CSCNormal\">This subject examines the normal physiological function of body systems and students are introduced to pathophysiology through discussion of the processes of degeneration, disease and injury across the lifespan. The characteristics and behaviour of micro-organisms and their relationship to infectious diseases and the immune response will also be explored. Selected drugs and their actions within the body will be introduced to students.</p>"
