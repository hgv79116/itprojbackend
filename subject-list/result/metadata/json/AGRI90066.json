    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will examine the major current issues in the management of soils under various land uses in Australia. The dynamic nature of soils will be explored through study of the chemical, physical and biological processes in the soil environment, particularly those which impact directly on plant growth. The subject should develop an understanding of how soils can be managed to optimise plant growth and minimise adverse effects on the environment and present practical solutions to soil management.</p>"
