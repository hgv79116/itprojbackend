        "<p>This subject will provide Masters-level training in some of the fundamental skills that will benefit the subsequent capstone projects in the Master of Geoscience. In particular, you will gain experience of applied research methods in environmental geology, hydrogeology, engineering geology, sequence stratigraphy, and economic geology. You will build on the fundamental skillset that you developed in Practical Earth Science A, developing a solid foundation of skills and understanding in these areas.</p>",
        "<p>Learning is built around a series of assignments that are designed to review key concepts and to develop practical skills. The subject is self-paced, with teaching staff available to provide guidance and feedback.</p>"
