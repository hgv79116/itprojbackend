    "overview": [
        "<p>The overall goal of this subject is to help students with a basic knowledge of Russian develop more sophisticated cultural and linguistic knowledge that allows them to feel comfortable thinking of themselves as users of Russian in listening, reading, writing and speaking. It develops students' notions of time and space as they play themselves out in talking and writing about such topics as Russian food, etiquette of addressing people, holidays and calendars, climate and Russian writers. Comparisons to current Russian life and society build the foundation for cultural literacy and familiarity with the Russian-speaking world.</p>"
