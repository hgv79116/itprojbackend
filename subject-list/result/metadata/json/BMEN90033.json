    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject teaches the fundamental theory, design and operational principles of biomedical instrumentation and measurement systems for the design of electronics for measurement and analysis of physiological parameters of the body and organs. The subject provides theory and practical exposure to understanding the basis of physiological signals and analysing biomedical signals, including hands-on experience in designing and building bioinstrumentation systems that can measure biological signals. Students will be introduced to medical devices, design principles, biomedical signals, biomedical instrumentation circuits and electrical safety and systems. These topics will be complemented by exposure to software tools for electronic circuit simulation and design. The subject is taught in a flipped classroom format and comprises: pre-tutorial reading, tutorials requiring student participation, guided workshops on using biosensors and transducers and individual self-paced project work.</p>"
