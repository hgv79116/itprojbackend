    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject aims to build Teacher Candidates\u2019 capacities for teaching Primary Humanities and the Social Sciences. Teacher Candidates will develop knowledge of the Primary Humanities curricula domains of Geography, History, Economics and Business, Civics and Citizenship. Teacher Candidates will be introduced to the Humanities as a broad, complex and dynamic field concerned with people as social beings who interact with one another and with natural and social environments through time and place. General capabilities will be addressed such as critical and creative thinking, intercultural understanding, ethical understanding and personal and social responsibility. Teacher Candidates will explore social and environmental issues in the Australian and global contexts. This includes learning about diversity, worldview and democratic principles to enable students to participate in our world as informed citizens. Teacher Candidates explore links to technological contexts, embedding digital technologies and creating design solutions. They will appreciate the important role technologies play in transforming, restoring and sustaining societies and supporting students to be regional and global citizens.</p>",
        "<p>Through review of social and environmental issues and the experience of an excursion to a site linked to primary students\u2019 Humanities learning, Teacher Candidates will further consider how the Humanities can be linked with other curriculum areas and in contexts beyond the school classroom.</p>"
