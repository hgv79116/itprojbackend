        "<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an ever growing field that holds the promise to revolutionise the way we develop drugs, treat and manage patients. In particular, Machine Learning has become an important tool to make sense of clinical data that is routinely collected and stored as electronic health records to enable personalised medicine.</p>",
        "<p>This subject aims to introduce students to different AI applications in health, using different clinical data sources and computational techniques, discussing their idiosyncrasies and the main challenges in the area.</p>",
        "<p>INDICATIVE CONTENT</p>",
        "<p>Topics covered may include: supervised, unsupervised learning and their applications in health scenarios, interpretable machine learning in health, natural language processing in health, process mining, data sources and clinical information modelling, data wrangling, harmonising and filtering, clinical image data and deep learning.</p>"
