    "overview": [
        "<p>Employment contracts have been a major source of litigation in recent years, with some cases leading to very large payouts. This subject examines the evolving law of employment contracts, and other related kinds of personal work contracts. Drawing on recent cases as well as leading articles by Australian and international scholars, the lecturers consider several key questions. These include determining and varying contract terms, employer and employee duties, non-compete clauses, termination and damages. The subject also looks at the interaction between employment contracts and major statutes, such as the Australian Consumer Law and the<em> Fair Work Act 2009 </em>(Cth). The subject seeks to combine discussions of the practical realities of contracting with a broader analysis of the underlying assumptions in current law.</p>",

        "<ul><li>The scope of employment regulation: which work relationships are covered?</li><li>The regulation of independent contracting, such as agency relationships</li><li>The content of the employment contract: express terms</li><li>The content of the employment contract: implied terms</li><li>Non-compete clauses and restraint of trade</li><li>Employment, the<em> Competition and Consumer Act 2010 </em>(Cth) and estoppel</li><li>Variation and flexibility in the employment contract</li><li>Termination and remedies at common law</li><li>The relationship between contracts, awards and agreements.</li></ul>"
