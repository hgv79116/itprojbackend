    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides a platform for students to apply their knowledge to designing studies with the aim of investigating topical problems in health and public health. Published guidelines for the reporting of studies will be used to assist with the design and appraisal of studies. Topics covered include: clinical trial design; observational studies including cohort, case-control and ecological; causal diagrams (to identify confounders and selection bias); effect modification; measurement error; external validity of findings; and principles of sample size.</p>",
        "<p>The collection and use of routinely collected data will be considered in health and public health settings. The cultural and ethical considerations of data collection with Indigenous populations will also be discussed.</p>"
