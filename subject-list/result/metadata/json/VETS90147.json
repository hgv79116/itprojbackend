    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject focuses on both the general principles of veterinary clinical practice and the specific approach to diagnosis, management and prevention of disease in dogs and cats. Content will be delivered in blocks based on clinical presentations related to gastrointestinal, urinary, nervous and non-specific clinical problems in parallel with presentations of the same systems in other species. This approach is designed to support students in the development of their diagnostic reasoning skills, and encourage a comparative view of veterinary medicine and surgery.</p>"
