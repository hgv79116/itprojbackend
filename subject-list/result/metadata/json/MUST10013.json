        "<p>This subject provides a foundational perspective of the history and major developments in Musical Theatre from the early 1900\u2019s through to the 1960\u2019s within social, cultural and historical contexts and as they connect to diverse objectives and influences. Skills in analysis of elements of structure and performance of music theatre works are also introduced.</p>",
        "<p>Students will develop skills in musicianship, aural studies and music theory. This will provide them with a music theory foundation for their practice-based voice studies. Through their research, practice of music theory and general musicianship students will develop a foundational knowledge of the origins of music theatre and how music works within music theatre. This subject includes an embedded program in academic literacy skills of analysis, discussion, essay writing, research and information retrieval.</p>"
