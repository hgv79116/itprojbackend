        "<p>Science provides a view of the living world and its environment that uses observation and measurement to build an understanding of the function of parts of a system and the interactions between them. This subject aims to develop students\u2019 understanding of this evidence-based approach, integrating the contributions of biology, chemistry, earth sciences and physics.</p>",
        "<p>Careful development of students\u2019 academic skills is embedded in this subject.</p>",
        "<p>Topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li><em>Matter and interactions:</em> an understanding of the basis of matter (atoms and molecules) and the organisation of matter at an atomic level, within living organisms and their environment;</li><li><em>Energy transfers and transformations:</em> Types of energy and relevance to the environment; mechanical and thermal energy transfers and transformations, behaviour of light and other electromagnetic radiation;</li><li><em>The global environment:</em> The global energy system and evolving global climates, atmosphere, ocean and water cycles, global ecology;</li><li><em>The living world: </em>What is life? Observations of the interactions of living things with their environment, the cycling of energy through living systems and their environment;</li><li><em>The consequences of change in the environment:</em> Living things and selective pressures, speciation and evolution.</li></ul>",
