    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject addresses what risk management is, why companies engage in risk management, and the tools available to manage risk. As part of this, the subject provides an introduction to basic derivative securities such as forward and futures contracts, options, interest rate and currency swaps, and credit derivatives. We deal with the issue of pricing derivative securities by simple arbitrage arguments, and develop a framework for analyzing and using financial derivatives in various applications. While the study of derivative securities is inherently quantitative, the subject also focuses on economic intuitions and interpretations behind derivative securities.</p>"
