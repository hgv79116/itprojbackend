    "overview": [
        "<p>Geotechnical Modelling and Design is a capstone subject in geotechnical engineering, focusing on  strengthening fundamental soil mechanics knowledge and further expanding practical geotechnical engineering knowledge and modelling skills. Students will grasp knowledge through lectures, laboratory practicals, tutorials and computer workshops, where emphasis is paid on self-learning and problem-solving skills. </p>",
        "<p>In this capstone subject, students are required to finish a practical design project by applying their knowledge to solve a number of design problems while considering multiple and sometimes conflicting design criteria which aims to strengthen their problem-solving skills.  This project provides a good opportunity for the student to apply technical knowledge (e.g. soil mechanics, water seepage and slope stability analysis) and strengthen engineering design skills (e.g. problem solving approach, trade-off analysis, data management, software modelling, communications, presentation). This is to prepare the students for employment in the industry, as well as future study or research.</p>",
        "<p>This subject builds on knowledge gained in subjects such as Engineering Mathematics, Fluid Mechanics and Earth Processes for Engineering and assumes familiarity with concepts of civil and geotechnical engineering. This subject also delivers introductory material for engineering graduate coursework subjects including Geotechnical Engineering, Civil Hydraulics and Quantitative Environmental Modelling.</p>",
        "<p>The subject will cover topics such as basic soil mechanics, stresses in soils, effective stress principle, Coulomb failure criteria, site investigation, permeability and seepage, flow nets, the effect of seepage on stability, slope stability principles, landslides, design and remediation, trade-off analysis in engineering design, and computer modelling to solve engineering design problems.</p>"
