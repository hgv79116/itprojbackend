        "<p>The study of contract builds on the foundations laid in LAWS50026 Obligations. It covers express terms (and their interpretation) and implied terms. The study of termination includes termination for breach, for failure of condition, and by frustration, and touches on the proprietary consequences of contracts. The study of invalidating factors includes misinformation (mistake, misrepresentation, misleading conduct), abuse of power (duress, undue influence, third party impropriety, unconscionable dealing, and unconscionable conduct) and illegality.</p>"
