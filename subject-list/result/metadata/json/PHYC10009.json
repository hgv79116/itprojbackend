    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is designed for students with a minimal background in Physics and aims to provide a foundation in physics understanding for a range of important physics principles and applications. Emphasis is placed on key concepts rather than detailed analysis. <br/>Topics include: </p>",
        "<p>Mechanics: describing and explaining translational motion (1-D and 2-D); laws of motion and forces; energy transfer; momentum and impulse; equilibrium in the context of human and animal movement and transport.</p>",
        "<p>Waves: explore wave properties of reflection, refraction, interference and diffraction of water, light and sound in the context of optics, hearing and ultrasound.</p>",
        "<p>Electrostatics and Electricity: describe than explain the effects of charge on different materials and objects; explore moving charges and electrical components such as batteries and resistors in simple electrical circuits.</p>",
        "<p>Magnetism: describe the effects and origin of magnetic fields; explore the relationship between charges and magnetic fields in the context of induction and electrical motors.</p>",
        "<p>Modern Physics: explore and describe the concepts behind the experiments that lead to our understanding of modern physics; Rutherford gold foil experiment, Double-Slit experiment and the Photoelectric Effect.</p>"
