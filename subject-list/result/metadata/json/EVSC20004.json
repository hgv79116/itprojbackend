    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will introduce students to the interrelationships among marine organisms and the ocean they live in and how these interactions are changing as a consequence of human activities. Topics covered include: ocean circulation, productivity and the impacts of climate change; coastal upwelling, food web dynamics and the impacts of fishing; coastal currents, species ranges and the effects of introduced marine pests; and land-sea connections, nutrient cycling and toxic algal blooms. How to study the interactions between the ocean and its flora and fauna will be investigated through a during a compulsory weekend field excursion. </p>"
