    "overview": [
        "<p>This course is an Honours level introduction to key concepts and approaches in field-based methodologies employed in sociocultural linguistics, with a particular focus on contemporary scholarship that takes a broad approach to language, culture, and society. It will examine current approaches to data collection and analysis in sociolinguistics as well as the use of statistical tools for sociolinguistic investigation. Students will master course concepts by applying them to their own data sets. The course provides students with theoretical knowledge, analytic skills, and professional socialization that will prepare them to pursue original research in sociolinguistics. This is a hands on course and students will be expected to collect different types of language data and analyse this across different methodologies.</p>"
