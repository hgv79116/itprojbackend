        "<p><span>This subject covers fundamental principles of electronic circuits, including how to design and analyse simple circuits, with example applications to biomedical problems. Also covered is biosignal analysis, in which students are taught the fundamentals of signal processing, including how to build simple signal models of a biological system, and how to measure and analyse system performance.  </span></p>",
        "<p><span> </span></p>",
        "<p><span>In the laboratories, students will learn how to build and analyse simple electronic circuits, as well as how to simulate and measure biosignals. Students will learn about laboratory safety, team-work and measurement safety in an integrated way. </span></p>",
        "<p><span> </span></p>",
        "<p><span>This subject is one of the subjects that define the Bioengineering Systems Major in the Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Biomedicine, and it is a core requirement for the Master of Biomedical Engineering. It provides a foundation for various subsequent subjects, including BMEN90002 Neural Information Processing and BMEN90021 Medical Imaging.</span></p>",
        "<p><strong><span>INDICATIVE CONTENT</span></strong></p>",
        "<p><span>Topics include:</span></p>",
        "<p><span>Basic principles of charge, current, Coulomb's law, electric fields and electrical energy, Kirchhoff's current law, Kirchhoff's voltage law, voltage and current division, node voltage analysis, mesh current analysis, Th\u00e9venin and Norton equivalent circuits, transient analysis of RC and RL circuits, steady-state analysis of RLC circuits, phasors and impedance, frequency domain models for signals and frequency response for systems, continuous-time and discrete-time Fourier transforms, frequency response, filtering, transfer functions, Z-transforms, Laplace transforms, poles and zeros, Bode plots, and the relationship to state-space representations.</span></p>",
        "<p><span>This material is complemented using software tools (e.g., MATLAB) for computation and simulation, and practical experience with circuits and systems in the laboratory.</span> <br/><br/></p>",
