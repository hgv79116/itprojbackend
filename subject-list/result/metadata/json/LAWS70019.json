    "overview": [
        "<p>Class actions have become an increasingly prominent feature of Australia\u2019s litigation landscape. Some people think they enhance access to justice, offer an efficient way to deal with large numbers of claims and function as an effective regulatory tool, while others criticise them as improper \u2018private\u2019 regulation or as just another way for lawyers to become wealthy. Students will have the opportunity to critically evaluate these views. Law reform proposals will be considered, as will the development, present state and likely future directions of the law and practice of Australian class actions. While the focus will be on Australia, methods used in other countries to bring and manage group proceedings will be considered and compared. Students will have the opportunity to engage and debate with lecturers and guest lecturers with substantial academic, practice, judicial and international experience.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>The origins of modern class action regimes in Australia</li><li>Comparisons of the federal and Victorian regimes with those in other Australian and overseas jurisdictions</li><li>The main stages of class action litigation</li><li>The roles of lawyers, judges, parties, litigation funders and regulators</li><li>Specific issues, including choosing a forum, defining the class, the role of the lead plaintiff, entrepreneurial lawyering, identifying and notifying class members, settlement and court approval</li><li>Comparing class actions with other procedures available for bringing and managing complex litigation</li><li>Securities class actions and the regulatory role of the class action</li><li>Funding and costs issues, including the role of commercial litigation funders.</li></ul>"
