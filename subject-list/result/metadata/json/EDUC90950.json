    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject examines contemporary global trends and the impact on policy directions at the national level. This includes the selection, development and monitoring of education policies. Through this subject, students will critically examine some of the key debates concerning notions of globalisation, how educational ideas circulate around the world, the role of global institutions (such as transnational corporations, intergovernmental organisations, NGOs and the media) in promoting particular views of education as a response to the demands of a global economy and a globally interconnected world. Students will draw on relevant theoretical and research literature to consider the impact on individuals, schools and communities.</p>"
