    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject contains four components, as described below.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Leadership:</strong></p>",
        "<p>Effective leadership provides direction, alignment and commitment for the collective. It is about courage, visibility and approachability. In this component students will learn:</p>",
        "<ul><li>How to improve individual self-awareness, self-management, social awareness and relationship management which are the building blocks for emotional intelligence in the workplace.</li><li>The alignment of intention with organisational impact.</li><li>Heightened understanding of how a leader\u2019s style impacts on organisational and team climate/culture.</li><li>A behavioural model of conflict management that contains the toxics elements of conflict in the syndicates and workplace.</li><li>An opportunity to practice leadership and team-management skills in syndicates that are applicable to the workplace.</li></ul>",
        "<p><strong>Data Analysis:<br/></strong></p>",
        "<p>Data analysis is the process of converting raw data into meaningful information to inform business decision-making. This component provides an introduction to the fundamental data analysis skills and techniques used in contemporary business and management.</p>",
        "<p>The component has an applied setting and a problem-solving focus. Concepts and theory are illustrated through business cases throughout. Each topic begins with a problem or decision being faced by a manager. This determines the variables to be measured, along with an appropriate analysis technique.</p>",
        "<p>The key skills developed in the course are Excel familiarity, data manipulation and the ability to produce and quickly interpret statistical output. The key concepts in the component are:</p>",
        "<ul><li>that real business data is partly but not wholly predictable;</li><li>that data-based conclusions always involve uncertainty and that this uncertainty can and must be quantified;</li><li>that simplistic analyses of data can often give a misleading view of business dynamics and lead to managerial mistakes; and,</li><li>that complex relationships between variables can be revealed through the tool of multiple regression.</li></ul>",
        "<p><strong>Marketing:</strong></p>",
        "<p>This component seeks to build knowledge and competency in the management of marketing analysis, marketing planning and marketing implementation in a range of business and non-business contexts. It emphasises the management of market-based assets and the value-creation and value-delivery processes. The key topics covered include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Market orientation</li><li>Market analysis and research</li><li>Market positioning</li><li>Marketing implementation</li><li>Market control</li></ul>",
        "<p><strong>Seminar I:</strong></p>",
