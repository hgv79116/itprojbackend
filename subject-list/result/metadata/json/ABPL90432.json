    "overview": [
        "<p>Building Information Modelling (BIM) and its associated technologies and processes can integrate the project team and facilitate high-quality and cost-efficient work. This subject will introduce BIM principles and break down the jargon around the topic of BIM. During tutorials, students will learn about the most popular BIM software in the industry and will work with the software to create and manage building project information throughout the design, construction and operation phases. To this end, students will develop 2D and 3D representations of a building information model using design BIM authoring software (e.g. Autodesk Revit). Later, BIM coordination software (e.g. Autodesk Navisworks) will be used for 3D model checking and detecting clashes in 3D disciplinary models, followed by developing a 4D BIM model (construction planning and simulation) as well as developing a 5D BIM model (quantification) of the given project. Throughout the process, students will use an online BIM collaboration platform to collaborate with their teammates and share project documents and information.</p>",
