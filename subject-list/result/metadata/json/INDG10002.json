    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will provide students with an introduction to the diversity, challenges and richness of Indigenous life and cultures worldwide. This subject gives students an opportunity to encounter Indigenous knowledges, histories, and experiences of colonialism through a range of interdisciplinary perspectives. Focusing on Indigenous scholars from around the globe, this subject engages contemporary cultural and intellectual debate. Social and political contexts will be considered through engagement with specific issues and a focus on Indigenous cultural forms, which may include activism, film, museum exhibitions, repatriation, and performance. Students will consider self-representation as a means by which to disrupt and expand perceptions of Indigenous identity.</p>"
