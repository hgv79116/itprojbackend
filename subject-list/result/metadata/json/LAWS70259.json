    "overview": [
        "<p>Medical practitioners, policy-makers, the courts, patients and families are dealing with ongoing debates in medical ethics ranging from euthanasia, abortion, resource allocation and managing the risks of research, to issues thrown up at the cutting-edge of science where we can now edit the germline, or create new life via so-called 'synthetic biology'. While we have existing legal frameworks in place for some of these issues, enormous moral disagreements remain. How should we think about these issues?</p>",
        "<p>This subject aims to provide a basic toolkit and skills to engage in deeper ethical reflection about the major debates in medical ethics and about advances in the biological and neurosciences. Professor Julian Savulescu is Director of the Centre for Practical Ethics, the Oxford Centre for Neuroethics and the Institute for Science and Ethics, University of Oxford. He is Editor of the <em>Journal of Medical Ethics </em>and is a recognised world leader in medical ethics. The goal of this subject is not to provide answers to these medical dilemmas, but to enable students to think more deeply for themselves about what their position is and to be able to justify that position to others. A variety of perspectives will be covered through the use of guest lecturers.</p>",
        "<p>The subject will cover recent ethical controversies arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, including triage of patients for ventilators, the ethics of lockdown, discrimination, antibody passports, vaccination, and accelerating research.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>The current revolution in bioethical reasoning and methods in bioethics</li><li>Making good medical/moral judgments for self and others</li><li>Basic ethical theories and concepts</li><li>Abortion</li><li>Euthanasia</li><li>Regulation of research, including:<br/><ul><li>Gene editing</li><li>Stem cell research and cloning</li><li>Transgenesis and human-non-human chimeras</li><li>Synthetic biology</li><li>Sale of biological material and body parts</li><li>Regulation of doping in sport</li><li>Reproductive cloning</li><li>Human enhancement</li><li>Genetic selection</li><li>Coercion in reproduction</li><li>Neuroethics</li></ul></li></ul>"
