    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject focuses on content language integrated pedagogy, in particular issues in the methodology of teaching in a second or foreign language, including such areas as setting goals and objectives; models of Content Language Integrated Learning programs; outcomes (including attainment in the discipline, language proficiency, ethnicity); use and avoidance of the first language; the importance of interaction in constructing meaning, clarifying knowledge and developing relevant language; and the dual role of the CLIL teacher in developing content knowledge and promoting language development. It will include a brief introduction to the theory and practice of second language teaching and learning in so far as it is relevant to CLIL (for example teaching relevant elements of the language such as new vocabulary, dominant structures, or text features and genres of a discipline).</p>",
        "<p>This subject has a TESOL or Modern Languages/LOTE focus, according to the course within which the student is enrolled</p>"
