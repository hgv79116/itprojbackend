    "overview": [
        "<p>Soil is the foundation for profitable farming. In this subject the principles of chemistry, physics and biology will be used to determine how decisions are made on the suitability of soil for agriculture and what effects agricultural practice can have on soil. Topics include soil morphology, soil physical and chemical properties, clay mineralogy, soil organic matter, soil biology &amp; ecology, soil acidity and alkalinity, and the biogeochemical cycles of C, N, and other elements as well as the environmental outcomes associated with the management of soils. The subject will enable students to understand the importance of soil knowledge for sustainable agricultural production. Students will undertake hands-on practicals, and field trips will be used to enable students to understand the relationship between landscapes, soils and land use, the impacts land management decisions can have on soil quality, and to describe soils for the purpose of enabling informed land management decision.</p>"
