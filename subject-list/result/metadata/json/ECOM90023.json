    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject aims to familiarize students with the tools commonly used for identifying and estimating treatment effects and evaluating programs and policies. Topics to be covered include the use and interpretation of Difference in Difference, Instrumental Variables, and Regression Discontinuity Design Estimators. The main theoretical ideas are illustrated with examples drawn from recent applications in the literature. Computer software such as Stata will be used. This subject also provides students with the experience of carrying out a research-based project on a specific topic in applied econometrics.</p>"
