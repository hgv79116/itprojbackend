        "<p>In this subject Teacher Candidates will develop and design a substantial independent investigation of a topic that they regard as directly related to their own professional practice and/or within their area of specialisation as the second part of their capstone experience in the Master of Teaching.</p>",
        "<p>The research project provides an opportunity for a sustained and systematic study of an issue in education practice. Candidates will define a feasible research question and inquiry within the project topic area, identify appropriate methodologies and methods to respond to the research question and understanding of ethical issues in education research (Note that students will not be allowed to undertake any project that involves the collection of primary data that requires Human Research Ethics Approval). The capstone project will culminate with students demonstrating capacity to extend professional learning through research.  Throughout this subject, Candidates will be expected to consider how research can inform and improve educational practice.</p>"
