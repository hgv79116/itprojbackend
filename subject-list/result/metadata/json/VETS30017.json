        "<p>Using clinical cases to illustrate principles, this subject introduces students to the normal structure and function of the hepatobiliary, urinary and endocrine systems of the domestic animals, the disease processes that may affect these systems, and the causes and potential consequences of such disease.  Students will develop skills in the clinical evaluation of the liver, urinary tract and endocrine system, including the selection and analysis of diagnostic tests of hepatic, renal and endocrine function. </p>"
