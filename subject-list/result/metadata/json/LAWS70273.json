    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject examines some legal aspects of a modern entertainment industry \u2013 in particular, contractual arrangements and intellectual property rights, as well as publicity and privacy rights. Particular reference will be made to the United States, home of the largest entertainment industry in the world, and Australia, which of course has its own important entertainment industry, but other countries will also be considered. The focus will be both on the written law (with an emphasis on legal development and policy) and the law as it is practised, with the latter part of the course devoted to a contract negotiation exercise. Cases and examples will mostly come from the fields of music, book publishing, the visual and performing arts and live theatre.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>The entertainment industry and measures of social value; stakeholders within and outside the industry; need for law; range of relevant laws</li><li>Intellectual property and misappropriation: copyright and neighbouring rights, moral rights, trade mark rights, publicity rights, passing off, trade secret protection and unfair competition</li><li>Contracting in the entertainment industry: licensing, joint ventures, examples of contracts in use (such as book publishing, music touring, character merchandising), and processes and strategies adopted in negotiation</li><li>Expansion of rights: technological developments, <em>sui generis</em> or incremental responses, United States and Anglo-Australian approaches</li><li>Privacy and related issues: implications for industry practice and entertainers</li><li>Practical exercises on negotiation and drafting book and merchandising contracts (explored in a workshop environment).</li></ul>"
