    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides the theoretical foundation for specialty emergency nursing practice.</p>",
        "<p>The concepts of assessment of the emergency department patient and the initial prioritising of care will be explored. In this subject, of study we will specifically examine the assessment and management of common illness or injuries seen in the emergency department, including those requiring resuscitation.</p>",
        "<p>In addition, the nursing and medical management of patients presenting with respiratory, cardiovascular or neurological dysfunction will be examined in detail. The theoretical concepts and knowledge gained will enable students to apply principles of assessment, triage and resuscitation in the emergency nursing context. The content will relate to management of paediatric and adult presentations with reference to physiological changes throughout the lifespan. Patient and family perspectives of illness will be considered in the development and implementation of multi-disciplinary care planning. Acknowledging the diversity of clinical presentations, emergency care will specifically focus on evidence-based interventions and their influence on patient outcomes.</p>"
