They will also undertake a research project completed over several weeks, which will require them to formulate a suitable hypothesis to investigate a physiological problem, select and test suitable techniques, design appropriate experimental protocols to test their hypothesis, collect and analyse their data, and write a scientific report on their findings.</p>"
