    "overview": [
        "<p>The law of the sea relates to the allocation of jurisdiction and peaceful uses of the seas and oceans, the equitable and efficient utilisation of marine resources, and the study, protection and preservation of the marine environment. Historically concerned with the \u2018freedom of the seas\u2019 for sovereign states, the law of the sea must also address contemporary and emerging challenges such as climate change, marine species preservation, pollution, overlapping territorial claims and national security. The overarching legal regime of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is supplemented by specific agreements as well as market techniques and supply chain oversight. This subject provides an overview and critique of the established and newly forming international regimes \u2013 and their interaction \u2013 and is informed by an institutional approach that acknowledges the influence of dispute settlement systems, non-state participation and transnational and administrative practices. The lecturers have published widely on fisheries law, trade law, the law of the sea and on the interaction between international legal regimes.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>The Law of the Sea Convention and associated instruments governing the high seas, including the Fish Stocks Agreement</li><li>Divisions of jurisdiction within the Law of the Sea, including key notions of the territorial sea, exclusive economic zones (EEZ), areas beyond national jurisdiction (high seas) and the sea-bed area</li><li>Binding and voluntary instruments of the Food and Agriculture Organisation, including the Compliance Agreement, the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and the Port State Measures Agreement, as well as emerging views on the ecosystem approach and marine protected areas</li><li>The International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling</li><li>World Trade Organization (WTO) rules relating to subsidies, labelling and trade restrictions on illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing</li><li>The Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and other multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs)</li><li>Marine pollution, including microplastics and greenhouse gas emissions from bunker fuels</li><li>Relevant dispute settlement bodies, including the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), arbitral bodies and the WTO.</li></ul>",
        "<p>Other topics may include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Marine protected areas, including efforts to create a new legally binding international agreement on Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ)</li><li>Freedoms of the seas in contested areas of jurisdiction (such as Sea Shepherd and Greenpeace\u2019s Arctic Sunrise)</li><li>Overlapping maritime claims such as the ruling on the South China Seas issued by an arbitral tribunal based at the Permanent Court of Arbitration</li><li>The role of indigenous rights, subsistence and artisanal practices</li><li>Selected regional approaches to fisheries management</li><li>The influence of legal approaches to climate change, especially with respect to low-lying island coastal states.</li></ul>"
