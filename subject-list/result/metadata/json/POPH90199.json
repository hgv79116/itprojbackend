    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will introduce sex/gender as a social construct. We will take a historical perspective to explore the women\u2019s health and men\u2019s health movements. We will compare and contrast the health of men and women and critically analyse the explanations that have been offered for both the differences and similarities. Case studies will be used to illustrate the contemporary ways in which practices of health care are gendered and the consequences for health (e.g. psychiatry, HRT use, cancer, heart disease and medical consultations). We will also analyse the ways in which public health programs are gendered and the consequences for health (e.g. screening programs, tobacco cessation etc). Finally, we will analyse the health consequences of gender relations in day-to-day life (e.g. in employment, housing, family).<br/><br/></p>"
