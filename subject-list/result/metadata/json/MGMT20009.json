        "<p>Why regulate employment? Do unions have too much power? How should pay be set? How can disputes at work be resolved? Should employees share in decision-making with management? These questions are central to contemporary debates over the policies and practices governing the relationship between managers and workers. This subject introduces students to the institutions, actors, and processes which shape the terms and conditions of work. An overview of key theoretical ideas provides the basis for examining major issues, trends and controversies in the regulation and management of employee relations.</p>",
