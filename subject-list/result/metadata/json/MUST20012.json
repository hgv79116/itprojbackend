Classes will focus on holistic techniques to integrate acting, singing and dancing within a context of large and small ensembles, as well as solo work.</p>",
        "<p>Students will regularly present autonomously prepared songs for lecturer feedback and a peer-group audience with corresponding critical self-assessment. Students will receive both informal and formal feedback throughout the semester. Through technical skills and reflection students will develop how to integrate acting, singing and dancing.</p>"
