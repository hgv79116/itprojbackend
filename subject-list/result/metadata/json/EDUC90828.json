    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will introduce participants to clinical practice in schools as a paradigm for learning and teaching. It will explore the importance of data, theory and research in informing interventionist teacher practice and introduce participants to models of clinical practice and the notion of clinical judgment. It will enhance participants\u2019 capacity to utilise individual student data in determining student zone of proximal development in order to establish the starting point for teaching. The developmental model of learning will provide the theoretical basis through which a range of assessment tools and feedback approaches are explored. There will be an emphasis on linking concepts studied to the school context.</p>"
