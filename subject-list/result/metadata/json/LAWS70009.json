    "overview": [
        "<p>Globalisation is driving corporate tax systems closer together and often into conflict. For many tax practitioners, it is now not enough to know their own corporate tax system\u2014they must grapple with and question the operation of other corporate tax systems. This subject seeks to develop an ability to understand and analyse any corporate tax system and assess its impact on corporate decision-making. With a dedicated textbook (written by the presenter), this subject compares a number of influential and archetypal corporate tax systems (both common law and civil law) and assesses their behaviour in the context of practical problems. For tax professionals, this subject develops an ability to ask direct and informed questions about a foreign corporate tax system and discuss that system at a high level with foreign tax professionals.</p>",
        "<p>This subject will compare and analyse corporate income tax law in selected countries (Australia, China, Germany and the US, with some reference to the UK) and consider how these laws interface with corporate law. Participants will be encouraged to discuss other jurisdictions with which they are familiar and students are permitted to cover other countries in their research paper. The approaches adopted are analysed by reference to various policy options available. There is a particular focus on problems caused by the artificiality of corporations.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Identification of entities (including hybrids) subject to corporation tax</li><li>Corporate groups and personal service companies</li><li>Debt versus equity and relief from economic double taxation of dividends</li><li>Cross-border corporate income and dividends</li><li>Gains/losses on the disposal of shares, takeovers and sale of loss companies</li><li>Corporate formation, share buy-backs and liquidation</li><li>Bonus issues, convertible notes, mergers and demergers.</li></ul>"
