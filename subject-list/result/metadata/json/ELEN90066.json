        "<p><strong>AIMS</strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject provides a practical introduction to the basics of modelling, analysis, and design of microprocessor-based embedded systems. Students will learn how to integrate computation with physical processes to meet a desired specification within the context of a design project. The project work will expose students to the various stages in an engineering project (design, implementation, testing and documentation) and a range of embedded system concepts.<br/><br/><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT<br/></strong></p>",
        "<p>Topics covered may include: digital computer and microprocessor architectures, modelling of dynamic behaviours, control, models of computation, operating systems concepts, multi-tasking, resource management and real-time behaviours, interfacing with the physical world, analysis and verification, safety, reliability, and security and privacy.<br/><br/>This material will be complemented by exposure to standard software tools including compilers and debuggers, finite state machine design and analysis software, and simulation tools. The subject will include a level of industry engagement, to provide broader examples of engineering projects, through guest lectures.</p>"
