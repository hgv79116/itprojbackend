        "<p>Industry Studies in Asia is a field study-based subject that allows students to apply the skills they have developed in the core subjects of the MBA program. The main deliverable in the subject is a detailed research report describing a study in one of the developing markets of Asia, typically China. The field study (or project) can focus on a specific organization, new or existing products/services/ventures, or entire industries. Students are also able to focus on a specific area of business such as marketing, finance, or human resources management. The subject is divided into two parts with the first part taking place in Melbourne in the semester immediately the field trip. The second part consists of a 10-day field trip in the selected Asian market, normally Shanghai. During the field trip students conduct primary research in the form of interviews with business executives, company visits, and other appropriate research techniques such as surveys.</p>"
