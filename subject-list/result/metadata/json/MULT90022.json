        "<p>\u2018Indigenous Research\u2019 is the core subject in the Professional Certificate in Indigenous Research (ProfCertIR), and is offered as a semester long blended course, comprising online and face-to-face components.<br/>The subject explores research and develops research skills from an Indigenous perspective, covering: selecting and refining a thesis topic; research design, methods and methodology; reviewing the literature; ethical issues in Indigenous research; intellectual property and copyright; establishing effective relationships with supervisors; managing scholarly information; qualitative and quantitative data collection, analysis and presentation; and planning and writing a thesis.</p>",
        "<p>The subject is taught in a mixed mode of seminars, case studies, and group activities, with an emphasis on collaborative learning. The format is interactive, with each session facilitated by an academic leader and/or panel of academics. Students engage in a range of activities, including structured reflection, academic writing, and formal verbal presentations. Students\u2019 assessment tasks relate directly to their own research.</p>",
        "<p>Upon satisfactory completion of the core subject, students are awarded a Professional Certificate in Indigenous Research, which will give them 25 credit points towards the Graduate Certificate in Indigenous Research and Leadership.</p>"
