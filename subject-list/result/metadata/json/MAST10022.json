    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject covers the same material as MAST10007 Linear Algebra, but to a greater depth including a greater emphasis on mathematical rigour and proof.</p>",
        "<p>This subject gives a solid grounding in key areas of modern mathematics needed in science and technology. It develops the concept of a vector space, including linear transformations, matrices and the methods of linear algebra. There will be an emphasis on the axiomatic treatment of vector spaces, linear transformations, and inner product spaces.</p>",
        "<p>Students will develop the ability to use the methods of linear algebra and gain an appreciation of mathematical proof including the ability to prove results about vector spaces.</p>",
        "<p>Topics covered include: systems of linear equations; matrices and determinants; vectors in real n-space, cross product, lines and planes; general vector spaces; linear independence; bases and dimension; linear transformations; eigenvalues and eigenvectors; inner product spaces; symmetric and orthogonal matrices; diagonalisation of linear transformations and matrices.</p>"
