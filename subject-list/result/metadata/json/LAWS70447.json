    "overview": [
        "<p>The focus of this subject is executive power, as it is understood in common law legal systems, with particular reference to executive power in Australia. Executive power has always played a critical role in systems of government, but in the 21<sup>st</sup> century it has become more significant than ever, for reasons that range from new modes of governance to the impact of globalisation. The subject will explore all facets of executive power: its historical evolution; relevant theoretical constructs; practical dimensions of its exercise; and the constitutional, legal, and parliamentary constraints to which it is subject. In doing so, it will engage with some of the most pressing contemporary challenges for the public law of executive power including the rationale(s) for the distinction between prerogative and \u2018common law\u2019 executive powers; judicial review of non-statutory executive power; executive power in a federal context; the executive and \u2018external\u2019 powers.</p>",
        "<p>The subject will draw on comparative material to examine issues and options for meeting these challenges. It should be of considerable interest to Australian and international students from all regions of the world with interests in public, comparative and/or international law.</p>",
        "<p>The syllabus will be organised around 5 key themes:</p>",
        "<ul><li><strong>Foundations</strong>, including history, political theory, and the structure and operation of the executive in a parliamentary system</li><li><strong>Legal framework,</strong> including the effect of written (and unwritten) Constitutions and the distinctions between statutory and non-statutory executive power, between the prerogative and other forms of non-statutory power and between law and policy; executive privilege and immunities.</li><li><strong>Constraints, </strong>including those presented by Parliament, by judicial review and by other forms of external review</li><li><strong>Key challenges for the domestic exercise of executive power, </strong>including judicial review of contract, spending and policy and the role of executive power in federal intergovernmental relations</li><li><strong>Key challenges for the external exercise of executive power, </strong>including the negotiation and implementation of international agreements and the commitment of armed forces.</li></ul>"
