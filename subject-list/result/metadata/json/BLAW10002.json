        "<p>Our laws regarding free speech and media emerged from an era of mainstream media institutions. Now every individual with a digital device and internet access can record, report and comment on events, and frequently does. The old paradigm of organised media and largely passive audience is breaking down. As a result, the regulation of free speech and media has to contemplate the whole gamut of communication from the highly institutionalised to the highly diffused, and the question is whether these diverse arrangements can be addressed while mitigating harms and without unduly constraining public debate.</p>",
