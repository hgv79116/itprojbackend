    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides an overview of selected topics in industrial organization with applications in antitrust and innovation policy. Industrial organization deals with the structure, management, and performance of firms and markets. It is concerned with firm behaviour and strategy, the implications of firm behaviour for economic efficiency, and the role public policy plays in promoting efficiency. The main emphasis will be on theoretical principles although there will be some discussion of empirical approaches. The selection of topics will be organized around key questions in antitrust and innovation policy. The discussion will be guided by practical examples and case studies.</p>"
