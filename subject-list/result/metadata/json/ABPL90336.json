        "<p>This subject requires students to study and research construction and conservation methods of East Asian timber buildings, and to produce drawings and writings highlighting details of such buildings. Students are also required to produce virtual displays highlighting the chosen structure, and possible alternatives, in their potential contexts.<br/><br/>As well as the above, students will be required to spend at least three hours a week in the construction workshop producing a full-size timber building that will be erected, initially, adjacent to the workshop and then in a public location.</p>"
