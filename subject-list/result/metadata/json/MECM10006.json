        "<p>Knowledge and language influence not only how we express our thoughts and participate in society, but also how we see the world and how the world sees us. Our communication is governed by genres that set cultural expectations and thus act as normative systems. Unfortunately, knowledge and genre can also become so normalised that they prevent positive cultural change. This subject enhances students\u2019 knowledge of media and genre theory by developing their communication and writing skills and empowering them to become eloquent advocates for change. Together, we will critically examine concepts of nationalism, Indigeneity, gender representation, and institutional power from a diverse range of voices to better understand their impact on local and global issues.</p>",
        "<p>Subject material will help students discuss and challenge social, cultural, and environmental inequalities through raising their ability to drive conversations for change. The strategies, which students will learn for planning, researching, and editing their work as well as that of others, will help them become more effective communicators and advocators. This will also be advantageous for other courses and their future career. MECM10006 is theoretically complementary to MECM10003 Media and Society.  </p>"
