    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject aims to encourage a broad and sophisticated understanding of, and critical thinking about, contemporary Australian family law, by drawing on recent debate, research, and legal and policy developments in the area, focusing on parenting and financial disputes on relationship breakdown. A key goal is to consider legislation and case law in the context of empirical and other research literature from Australia and overseas to explore law in action. This is a particularly important goal given the importance of social sciences knowledge and professional skill in family law practice, research, policy and reform.</p>",
        "<p>Family law is a rapidly changing area of law. Specific areas of emphasis throughout the subject will be influenced by contemporary developments. However, in broad terms the topics covered will include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Relationship recognition and flow-on impacts of this in family law;</li><li>Post-separation parenting law and process;</li><li>Family violence and family law: the relevance of family violence to both process and the substantive law (parenting and financial disputes);</li><li>Child support;</li><li>Property division on marriage and de facto relationship breakdown; and</li><li>Spouse/partner maintenance.</li></ul>"
