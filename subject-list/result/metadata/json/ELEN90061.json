        "<h3>AIMS</h3>",
        "<p>This subject introduces the basic principles, analysis, and design of communication networks. It covers relevant analytical methods, the layered network architecture of the Internet, and a multitude of network protocols.</p>",
        "<p>Analytical tools from queueing, optimisation, and graph theories are used to develop an in-depth understanding of basic principles and the role they play in network design. Specifically, queueing and graph theories are emphasised as methodological frameworks for communication network delay and structure analysis.</p>",
        "<p>The concepts taught in this subject lead to a better understanding of the Internet as well as modern communication paradigms such as Software-Defined Networks, Machine-to-Machine communication, Internet of Things, and social networks.</p>",
        "<h3>INDICATIVE CONTENT</h3>",
        "<p>Topics covered may include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>The layered network architecture with a focus on physical-layer multiple access (TDM, FDM, WDM), link layer protocols and medium access control (MAC), network layer topologies, least-cost routing algorithms and protocols, transport layer protocols and the principles and techniques of practical reliable transport;</li><li>LAN protocols, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and serial communications;</li><li>The Internet's network layer including the Internet Protocol (IP) and routing protocols including an introduction to BGP and the operation of forwarding tables in routers and shortest prefix routing;</li><li>The Internet's transport layer protocols UDP and TCP, including the flow and congestion control algorithms;</li><li>Network security, application layer, cloud and fog computing, Machine-to-Machine communication, and Internet of Things;</li><li>Queuing theory: basics, birth-death processes, M/M/x and Markovian queues, networks of queues;</li><li>Basics of graph theory and social network analysis relevant to communication networks.</li></ul>"
