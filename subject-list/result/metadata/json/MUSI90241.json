    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will explore contemporary educational and disability theories relevant to supporting music learners with diverse needs. Students will gain evidence\u2010based and applied knowledge of ways to support the inclusion of people with neurodevelopmental conditions and learning differences in music skill development. Contemporary theory and research across relevant disciplines of music, health and education will be synthesised and analysed. Through case\u2010based learning and role play, students will demonstrate their knowledge of theory and research by designing individualised learning plans. Students will also critically appraise various strategies to support diverse music learners.</p>"
