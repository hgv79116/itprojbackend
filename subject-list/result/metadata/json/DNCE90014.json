    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject explores different methodological approaches for the postgraduate study of dance. Drawing upon recent developments in the Dance Studies field with a focus on inter-disciplinary praxis, this subject encourages the critical alignment of concepts, practices and theories with dance as a way of knowing and embodied movement culture.</p>",
        "<p>This subject proposes philosophical enquiry into the nature of dance through an inter-disciplinary lens. Addressing some of the fundamental issues for engaging with dance intellectually and sensorially, it invites students to probe and unpack legacies of dance history in relation to artistic movements and be innovative in analysing future possibilities for convergences between dance and other disciplines.</p>",
        "<p>It is directed towards critically addressing historical, artistic-aesthetic and cultural-political dimensions of dance and developing methods for navigating the tensions and possibilities evident in interdisciplinary research.</p>"
