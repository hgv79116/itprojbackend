    "overview": [
        "<p>Almost all financial phenomena are a consequence of human decision-making. Elucidating the psychological nature of decision-making is therefore critical for understanding many issues in finance. This subject provides students with knowledge of major trends in this interdisciplinary research field which combines elements of both psychology and finance. The subject introduces methods of examining psychological mechanisms underlying human decision-making, and how these mechanisms can explain anomalies in financial behaviour that cannot readily be explained by existing methods in the finance discipline.</p>"
