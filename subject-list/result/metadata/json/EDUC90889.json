    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will support Teacher Candidates\u2019 understanding of science as both a body of knowledge and the enactment of skills and processes associated with scientific thinking, reasoning and inquiry. Teacher Candidates will learn how to use scientific thinking to engage children in science learning experiences and to encourage children\u2019s use of scientific thinking, reasoning and inquiry in order to develop science knowledge.</p>",
        "<p>Seminar topics are centred on children\u2019s everyday lives and the natural world. Topics draw on contemporary research evidence and introduce science content knowledge. In addition, the subject explores opportunities for teachers to collaborate with children, their families and the wider community whilst investigating opportunities for sustainable living. The subject will equip Teacher Candidates to teach children from infancy to eight years of age and is informed by the Victorian Early Years Learning and Development Framework and the science standards in the Victorian Curriculum Foundation to Level Two.</p>",
        "<p>Topics include the relationship between climate change and sustainability, the basic needs of all living things, principles of \u2018classification\u2019 in science, plants and their uses in everyday life, invertebrates (\u2018minibeasts\u2019) and their characteristics, air and water, light and sound, magnetism and electricity, technology, and space and the universe. Teacher Candidates will design, implement, review and refine sequences of science learning experiences.</p>"
