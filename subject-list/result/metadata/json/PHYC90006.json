        "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Optics and photonics are vibrant international research areas, advancing many aspects of modern life. From the determination of the structure and function of biomolecules to the study of stars and galaxies; from high-efficiency lighting to innovative display technologies, our understanding of optics relies on fundamental underpinnings in advanced quantum mechanics and wave theory.</p>",
        "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The course includes the foundations of modern optical theory, including Fourier transforms in optics and diffraction-based imaging; non-linear optical processes such as generation of white light from femtosecond laser pulses, gigahertz optical modulators, and liquid crystal displays; light-atom interactions, the Einstein description of lasers, and optical Bloch equations; holography; quantum optics including zero-point energy and vacuum fluctuations; quantum states of light and quantum squeezing; laser cooling of atoms, atom interferometry, and Bose-Einstein condensation.</p>",
        "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Students will develop both analytic and computational problem-solving methods, the latter using standard tools such as MATLAB.</p>"
