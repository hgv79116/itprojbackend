    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject develops the mathematical methods of applied mathematics and mathematical physics with an emphasis on ordinary differential equations. Both analytical and approximate techniques are used to determine solutions of ordinary differential equations. Exact solutions by localised series expansion techniques of second-order linear ordinary differential equations and Sturm-Liouville boundary value problems are explored. Special functions are introduced here. Regular and singular perturbation expansion techniques, asymptotic series solutions, dominant balance, and WKB theory are used to determine approximate solutions of linear and nonlinear differential equations. Throughout, the theory is set in the context of examples from applied mathematics and mathematical physics such as nonlinear oscillators, boundary layers and dispersive phenomena.</p>"
