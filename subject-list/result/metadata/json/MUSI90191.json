    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides research higher degree students in performance and composition with the tools and skills necessary to devise and conduct research in music at postgraduate level. Through seminars, group discussions and peer review sessions students will engage with the key principles of research and academic writing, and integrate them into their artistic practice.</p>",
        "<p>Students will be supported in defining and focusing their research questions, developing a critical summary of the literature, constructing an adequate conceptual framework, designing a methodology, adhering to and meeting deadlines, and presenting their work persuasively, both in oral and written form. The main outcome will be a full research project that could potentially serve as the basis for either confirmation of candidature or conversion from Masters to PhD document.</p>"
