    "overview": [
        "<p>We begin by evaluating a range of theoretical perspectives on people, work, and employment. The emphasis will be on understanding and applying different conceptual perspectives to human resource management. The disciplinary foundations for the body of research reflected in this course are psychology, social-psychology and sociology, industrial relations, and management. We will review classics and contemporaries, theories and empirics, and interesting contradictions and consistencies to understand the impact of HR activities on employees and organisations. The course seeks to develop a thorough understanding of the ontological (the \u201cwhat\u201d of the topic) and epistemological (the \u201chow we research\u201d) foundations of the topics covered. Note, however, our coverage of research methods will be driven by the topic rather than vice-versa. As such, students will explore and critique frameworks, theories, methodologies, and conclusions from prior research, and develop their own perspectives on the topics.</p>"
