        "<p>This subject will explore the issues of evidence construction and use in practice, allowing participants to reflect on their professional experience and develop their ability to be \u2018smart consumers\u2019 of information in a professional setting. It will explore how evidence is created, by whom, and for what purpose, exposing participants to the ongoing debates regarding evidence-based policy-making, data-driven decision-making, and, more broadly, the creation of knowledge. It will place a particular emphasis on the complex relationship between scientific advancement and the challenges this poses to leaders, managers and policy makers. </p>",
        "<p><em>Using Evidence</em> is one of the core subjects in the Melbourne School of Government's Public Administration program. It is one of three professionally-oriented subjects that builds on <em>The World of Public Administration</em> and the core discipline subjects to develop the professional skills of participants with a particular focus on using evidence in managerial practice.</p>"
