        "<p>Students will write and produce a short motion picture production, from concept to completion, finished to industry standard. Students also crew on other student productions in key areas, including camera, lighting, sound recording, production management, and assistant directing. Through collaboration with peers, within an interdisciplinary framework, students continue to develop and refine leadership and interpersonal skills.</p>"
