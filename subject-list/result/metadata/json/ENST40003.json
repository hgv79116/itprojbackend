        "<p>This subject develops a student\u2019s ability to design and undertake a research project in the fields of ecosystem science, landscape management or forest science and their related social sciences and to report on this in written and verbal form. The project is completed under supervision of an academic staff member of the School of Ecosystem and Forest Sciences or an approved external supervisor, depending on the particular research project. The research topic is developed in collaboration between student and supervisor prior to or early in the first semester of enrolment.</p>",
        "<p>Students enrol in a total of 75 points of research project across the duration of the Honours program. This is achieved by enrolling in two subjects across two consecutive semesters to achieve a total 75 credit points. Students enrol in a Part 1 subject in the first semester and a Part 2 subject in the second semester of the program.</p>",
        "<p>This subject is a 37.5 point version for one semester.</p>",
