        "<p>Foundations of Electrical Networks develops an understanding of fundamental modelling techniques for the analysis of systems that involve electrical phenomena. This includes networks models of \u201cflow-drop\u201d one-port elements in steady state (DC and AC), electrical power systems, simple RC and RL transient analysis, and networks involving ideal and non-ideal operational amplifiers.<br/><br/>It forms the foundation of many engineering subjects exploring fundamental concepts in electrical and electronic engineering.<br/><br/>The subject will cover key electrical engineering topics in the areas of:<br/>Electrical phenomena \u2013 charge, current, electrical potential, conservation of energy and charge, the generation, storage, transport and dissipation of electrical power.<br/>Network models \u2013 networks of \u201cflow-drop\u201d one-port elements, Kirchoff\u2019s laws, standard current-voltage models for one-ports (independent sources, resistors, capacitors, inductors, transducers, diodes), analysis of static networks, properties of linear time-invariant (LTI) one-ports and impedance functions, diodes, transformers, steady-state (DC and AC) analysis of LTI networks via mesh and node techniques, equivalent circuits, and transient analysis of simple circuits;<br/>Electrical power systems \u2013 overview of power generation and transmission, analysis of single-phase and balanced three-phase AC power systems.</p>",
        "<p>Analysis and design of networks involving ideal and non-ideal operational amplifiers.</p>",
        "<p>This material will be complemented by exposure to software tools for the simulation of electrical and electronic systems and the opportunity to develop basic electrical engineering laboratory skills using a prototyping breadboard, digital multimeter, function generator, DC power supply, and oscilloscope.</p>",
