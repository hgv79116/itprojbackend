    "overview": [
        "<p>Communities of arts practices feature in arts based research internationally. These communities are multi, inter and cross disciplinary, existing in multiple spaces and places and offer openings to new thinking, ideas and collective learning. This subject provides a connection with the discourse of communities of arts practices, professional connections and openings into those communities yet to be encountered. You will identify and position yourself within communities of arts based practices from multidisciplinary and international sites. Through reflective practice, you will explore their own professional practices in relation to these communities of arts practices. This subject will allow professionals to explore, design and develop their own arts communities within contemporary arts educational practice.  </p>"
