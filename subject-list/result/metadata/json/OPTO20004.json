    "overview": [
        "<p>Nothing you see is real. You have no direct access to your physical world other than through your senses. In this subject you will learn the science behind the fundamental perceptual processes underlying your sense of vision, including: motion and time perception, luminance and contrast perception, colour perception, geometry perception, space and size perception, and face perception. Visual illusions will be used to highlight key features of these complex perceptual processes, and you will develop an understanding of how the scientific basis of these processes is informed by research into vision and visual illusions. You will extend your understanding by exploring how artists (including graphic designers and moviemakers) exploit these processes for visual impact or aesthetic effect.</p>"
