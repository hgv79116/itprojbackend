    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject examines the relationship between language and society in Europe. It focuses on issues of relevance in an increasingly integrated Europe in which European and other languages are in contact through migration, travel, business, and mass media, and in which English is taking on an important role as a lingua franca. The topics to be covered include: the relationship between majority and minority languages, dialects and the standard language, bilingualism and multilingualism, semi-communication, language planning at state and European levels, politeness and forms of address, and the status and influence of English.</p>"
