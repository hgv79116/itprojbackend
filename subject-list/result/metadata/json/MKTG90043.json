    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces students to the large number of digital metrics available, including engagement ratios, click-through rates, conversion ratios, customer lifetime value and related concepts. Particular attention is paid to the reasons for using these metrics, what these metrics measure precisely, and how they can be used to achieve desired outcomes. Some sessions will be spent on introducing key analytics platforms, such as Google analytics and similar. As such, this course expands students' knowledge of major measurement tools, theories and state of the art thinking in the measurement of digital marketing performance.</p>"
