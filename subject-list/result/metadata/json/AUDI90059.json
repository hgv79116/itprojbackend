        "<p>In this subject, students will be introduced to features of the anatomy and physiology of the auditory system (peripheral and central), including those related to balance and speech production. The subject will also explore the impact of different pathologies and diseases on the structure and function of the ear and the impacts of this on the individual across the lifespan.<br/><br/>The subject ensures students gain a clear understanding of the mechanisms underlying the auditory pathway and an insight into the systems underpinning listening. Students will participate in lectures and workshops that will assist in understanding how each anatomical and physical feature of the auditory system is essential for normal processing.</p>",
        "<p>By the end of this subject, students will have a thorough understanding of how the auditory pathway functions, the potential impacts of pathologies on the pathway and the implications of these pathologies on an individual\u2019s ability to listen and communicate.  </p>"
