        "<p>This is a studio capstone subject in which students develop an independent design project in response to a set site and design brief. The capstone  subject framed by contemporary agendas in landscape architecture, the capstone studio uses research from design theory and ecology to explore the interrelation between site and design. Emphasis is placed on a landscape process-based approach. Students explore a range of design methods as part of a holistic practice of developing, creating, and delivering a speculative landscape project. The capstone studio aims to enhance design skills and prepare students for entry into the postgraduate professional degree.</p>",
