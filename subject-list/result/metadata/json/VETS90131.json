        "<p>This subject introduces students to the study of parasitic infectious agents as causes of disease in animals. It includes the important features and life cycle considerations of common and important ectoparasites and strongyloid nematodes, the host-parasite interaction and the pathogenesis of disease, disease transmission and epidemiology, methods of diagnosis of parasitic disease as well as prevention, control and treatment.</p>"
