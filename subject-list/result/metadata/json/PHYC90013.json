    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides an advanced introduction to condensed matter physics. The general topics covered are (i) experimental and theoretical aspects of the characterisation of condensed matter using electrons and x-rays and (ii) the quantum model of solids and its relevance to semiconductor and mesoscopic physics. Specific topics covered may include: (i) the imaging of condensed matter at the atomic level and (ii) the determination of how atoms are bonded; (iii) application of imaging beyond the nanoscale; (iv) magnetism; (v) superconductivity; (vi) the properties of semiconductor devices and (vii) mesoscopic systems.</p>"
