        "<p>This subject builds on the theoretical and skill base of SCWK90069 <em>Researching Social Work Practice 1, </em>with students learning to apply the research method of a scoping review. Students will be encouraged to select a field of social work practice of interest, and to explore, organise and develop an overview of the existing published evidence base. This subject will introduce students to each phase of the research method, including establishing a research question, identifying relevant studies, selecting appropriate studies and collating summarizing and reporting the results of the review of literature. The subject concludes with a focus on preparing research findings for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.</p>"
