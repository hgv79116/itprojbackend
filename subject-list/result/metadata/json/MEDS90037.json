        "<p>This capstone subject draws together students\u2019 learning in the context of contemporary health care delivery and prepares the student for the next phases of medical training (prevocational and vocational).\u202fTransition to Practice A is a full-time clinical placement subject that bridges the learning and experiences acquired in PCP2 and PCP3a and the pre-intern competencies to be fully achieved by the end of this capstone subject. Each student\u2019s experiences in this subject will be tailored to the individual, taking into account the experiences and learning they have already acquired in their PCP2 and PCP3 journeys. By the end of this year, students will have completed the core competencies from PCP2 and PCP3a, and those required for internship. Students will achieve this by being fully immersed in the clinical environment and demonstrating these competencies on placement.  </p>"
