        "<p>The aim of engineering and scientific research is to produce new knowledge. To be useful, new knowledge must be able to stand up to scrutiny, and its presentation to other researchers and/or to the public must be persuasive.<br/>This subject is an introduction to the processes of research as they apply to chemical and biochemical engineering, including chemical and biological safety and risk assessment, locating and critically analysing relevant literature, designing experiments, analysing data, writing papers, writing research proposals giving presentations and refereeing. Underlying all of these, the subject will foster the development of critical thinking, a sceptical, scientific perspective, and professional ethics.</p>",
