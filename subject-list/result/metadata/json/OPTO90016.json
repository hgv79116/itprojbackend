    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is to allow optometrists to advance their capabilities in the day-to-day management of eye disease by affording them the opportunity to review the most current ideas on the pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of ocular disease affecting the back of the eye, thus also preparing them for any further shifts in the scope of optometric practice in this area. This review will include a critical examination of how the state-of-the-art diagnostic and imaging tools can be incorporated into clinical practice. Given the explosion in the literature of health sciences, the course will concentrate on developing a deep understanding in a select group of eye diseases regularly seen in optometric practice (for example, glaucoma, diabetes, age-related macular degeneration). The course will, however, provide optometrists with the tools necessary to develop a deeper, evidence-based understanding in other eye diseases of their choosing.</p>"
