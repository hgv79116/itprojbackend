        "<p>This subject explores contemporary theories and modes of critique relating to the modern designed landscape. The lectures and readings introduce and examine significant 20th and early 21st century theoretical writings and design treatises. This will include the contextualization of landscape architecture against theoretical developments in allied design fields including urban design, architecture and the visual arts. Assignments and class papers require students to critically engage with a broad range of theoretical positions, and relate them to built works.</p>"
