    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will provide students the opportunity to develop skills in field geology that are highly valued in the environmental, resource development, engineering, and mining industries. Students will learn to identify minerals, rocks, sediments, structures, and geomorphic features in the field and using remote sensing imagery, and to express them through geological maps, cross-sections and reports. Students will learn how to collate and interpret diverse geological observations and to use these data to develop models of geological histories across multiple time-scales. Students will gain a rich understanding of how geological mapping and other field methods can be used to inform decision-making across a wide array of contemporary challenges, including hazard identification, risk reduction, and sustaining future Earth.</p>"
