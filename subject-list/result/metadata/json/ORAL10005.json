    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will commence as a pre-clinical laboratory subject, building practical skills to prepare students for dental clinical practice. Students will develop initial manual dexterity and self-evaluation skills using virtual simulation facilities. Students will apply knowledge of disease processes, anatomy, common materials, equipment and instrumentation, and techniques for the management of caries (decay) and periodontal (gum) diseases. Students will undertake tasks on manikins to develop skills in preparing and restoring lost tooth structure (fillings), and in periodontal cleaning. Students will learn about correct posture, safety, and working as a team (assistant and operator) in the dental operatory during the provision of these procedures.</p>",
        "<p> </p>",
        "<p>Students will develop knowledge and skills regarding clinical dental practice. The clinical procedures of history taking, clinical examination, diagnosis and provision of simple treatment plans will be introduced and students will gain knowledge of dental record keeping requirements. Students will gain knowledge of their responsibilities under the law to provide a safe environment for their patients, staff and themselves, together with knowledge of the current published standards of practice. Students will also gain knowledge of infection control strategies, practice protocols and documentation required to provide a safe clinical environment. Clinical sessions will allow students to practise and reinforce the skills in safe work practices and infection control procedures while practising the clinical skills of history taking, clinical examination, plaque index, prophylaxis and application of topical fluoride. During these clinical sessions, students will develop skills in ergonomic work practices in a clinical environment.</p>",
        "<p> </p>",
        "<p>Student learning will include patient-centred oral health care practice. They will learn to classify periodontal diseases and develop skills in non-surgical periodontal debridement. They will also be introduced to the concept and evidence of minimal intervention dentistry and how it relates to non-surgical management and surgical treatment of dental caries and restoration of teeth. Students will gain knowledge of dental materials commonly used for direct restorative procedures. Students will also be introduced to dental radiology, dental radiographic techniques and interpretation of radiographs.</p>"
