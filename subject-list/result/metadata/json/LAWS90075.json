        "<p>Patents are the law\u2019s primary mechanism for providing incentive for the generation of inventions, and for regulating the use of inventions by others. Trade secrets are confidential details about commercial products and services, protection for which is available through either an action for breach of contract or an action in equity to restrain a breach of confidence. This subject explores in detail the law, policy and practice of the patent regime, of the trade secrets protection mechanisms, and of the relationship between the two. The principle topics considered include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>The international framework for protection of patentable inventions and trade secrets;</li><li>The subject matters capable of protection by a patent;</li><li>The requirements for the grant of a valid patent;</li><li>The exclusive rights granted by a patent;</li><li>The infringement, and the defences to infringement, of a patent;</li><li>The subject matter of, and requirements for, trade secrets protection;</li><li>The scope of protection provided to trade secrets; and</li><li>The relationship between patent protection and trade secrets protection.</li></ul>"
