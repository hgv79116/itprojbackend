    "overview": [
        "<p>The subject aims to provide a foundation for original research in the fields of behavioural and experimental economics. First, it explores how behavioural economics extends traditional economics by incorporating insights into human behaviour derived from other fields such as psychology and sociology. Students will be exposed to both empirical research that investigates pattern of behaviour which deviates from standard economic assumptions, and theoretical research that aims to incorporate these behaviour in tractable models. Second, the subject familiarises students with experimental methodology, analysis of experimental data, and the range of application of experimental methods in economics, such as the evaluation of economic theories and behavioural assumptions, as well as their applications to policy research.</p>"
