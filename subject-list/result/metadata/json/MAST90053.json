        "<p>Modern computers have developed far beyond being great devices for numerical simulations or tedious but straightforward algebra; and in 1990 the first mathematical research paper was published whose sole author was a thinking machine known as Shalosh B Ekhad. This course will discuss some of the great advances made in using computers to purely algorithmically discover (and prove!) nontrivial mathematical theorems in for example Number Theory and Algebraic Combinatorics. Topics include: Automated hypergeometric summation, Groebner basis, Chaos theory, Number guessing, Recurrence relations, BBP formulas.</p>"
