        "<p><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT</strong></p>",
        "<p>The first step in the development of any non-trivial software system is an analysis of the problem domain in order to formulate a requirements specification. In this subject students will explore the aims, principles, processes and techniques involved in business and domain analysis and the formulation of requirements. Topics covered will include: an understanding of the domain analysis problem; business and domain analysis; an exploration of methods for eliciting, analysing, specifying and validating requirements; requirements metrics; analysis techniques for \u2018special domains\u2019 drawn from a selection of enterprise systems, safety critical systems, usability and security.</p>",
