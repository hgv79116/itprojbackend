    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject builds on the material covered in the Trade Marks and Unfair Competition subject. Trade Mark Practice focusses on the procedures and practices of the Australian Trade Marks Office in obtaining and maintaining registered trademarks.

The lecturers in the subject have extensive experience in the obtaining of trade mark registrations and the subject meets the Trans-Tasman IP Attorneys Board (TTIPAB) requirements for \u2018Topic Group B\u2019 and \u2018Topic Group D\u2019.</p>",
