    "overview": [
        "<p>Mind, Brain &amp; Behaviour A (MBBA) is a 12.5-point subject equivalent to PSYC10003 Mind, Brain and Behaviour 1. It is taught entirely online in an intensive format in the first six weeks of semester 2. It can be taken in conjunction with Mind, Brain &amp; Behaviour B (MBBB) which is a 12.5-point subject equivalent to PSYC10004 Mind, Brain and Behaviour 2 that is taught entirely online in an intensive format in the second half of semester 2. MBBA and MBBB can be taken together in succession within the same semester. Doing so would allow a student to enter the Psychology Major mid-year and complete all the first-year requirements of the major within semester 2. Alternatively, students can complete all the first-year requirements of the Psychology Major by taking MBBA then PSYC10004 Mind, Brain and Behaviour 2. Students may not take both MBBA and PSYC10003 Mind, Brain and Behaviour 1 as these subjects cover the same content.</p>",
        "<p>The purpose of MBBA is to provide an introduction to psychology. It describes how we sense and perceive our world to construct our own internal psychological experience. It explores how we learn, think, remember, and operate within our constructed worlds and it describes the neural mechanisms that underpin these psychological processes and experiences.</p>",
        "<p>It covers the following three topic areas: Sensation and Perception; Learning and Cognition; and Behavioural Neuroscience. Students are given the opportunity to develop and apply a range of fundamental skills in areas of critical thinking, psychological research methods, and communication of psychological knowledge. The subject is designed to raise significant questions, prompting students to think about their own individual experiences and the experience of others.</p>",
        "<p>Students are introduced to the tools used in psychology to find answers to these questions. A common research-centred framework is adopted, and the methodological and statistical tools that support this framework are introduced and developed as an integral part of the subject.</p>",
        "<p>Although the online modules for this subject will be released all at once, they are designed to be studied in a progressive fashion and students will be encouraged to work through them at a constant rate, in sync with the weekly e-tutorials. Weekly quizzes will help ensure that students stay up-to-date with the modules and on track to achieve the desired learning outcomes.</p>"
