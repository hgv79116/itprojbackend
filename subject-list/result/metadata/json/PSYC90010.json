    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject focuses on the interplay between developmental factors and psychological functioning across the lifespan. Key developmental tasks and transitions at each developmental stage, spanning from the perinatal period through to the end-of-life period, will be reviewed.  Students will practice applying this knowledge to clinical case formulation. Approaches to engagement, assessment, diagnosis, and intervention at each developmental stage will be reviewed, and ways in which interventions need to be tailored in light of maturational and contextual variables will be discussed. Topics covered will include mental health in the perinatal period; the implications of attachment for later psychological functioning; social, emotional and behavioural problems of early and middle childhood; engaging adolescents; developmental tasks and transitions in early adulthood, mid-life and old age; and psychological intervention in the context of dementia.</p>"
