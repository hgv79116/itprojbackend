    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject develops participants\u2019 knowledge and understanding about how learning can be conceptualised, evidenced, assessed and progressed.</p>",
        "<p>To this end, participants will:</p>",
        "<p>\u2022 Explore learning identities and the factors that shaped them. <br/>\u2022 Use and apply the clinical practice model to learning and teaching. <br/>\u2022 Develop an understanding of foundational assessment practices; particularly, the use of a taxonomical construct to inform judgments about student achievement and readiness to learn. <br/>\u2022 Explore theoretical perspectives on furthering student learning, the curricular implications of these perspectives, and the historical development of pedagogical thought. <br/>\u2022 Use and apply feedback strategies to report both to and upon student learning.</p>",
        "<p>This subject prepares participants for EBLT2, which requires an evaluation of theory and practice in light of an evidence-based analysis of student learning.</p>",
        "<p>This subject along with Learning &amp; Teaching Contexts 1 and Language, Literacy and Numeracy, requires participants to implement the Clinical Praxis Exam. It also provides them with the opportunity to apply their learning in preparing to teach secondary school students attending the Faculty of Education Summer School Program, as well as through their everyday teaching in schools.</p>"
