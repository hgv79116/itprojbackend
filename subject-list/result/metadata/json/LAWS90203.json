    "overview": [
        "<p>Learning in this subject is based around the examination of a number of use-cases for AI in the sciences, including such applications as data analytics, modelling, scientific discoveries and therapeutic devices. After conversations covering preliminary material on AI, Ethics, Law and Human Rights, these use-cases will be employed as basis for investigating the issues with particularly relevant themes drawn from the broader thematic domains.</p>",
        "<p>Themes to be covered may include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Trust</li><li>Accountability, Transparency &amp; Explainability</li><li>Beneficence &amp; Non-maleficence</li><li>Fairness &amp; Justice</li><li>Autonomy</li><li>Licensing</li><li>Liability</li><li>Privacy</li><li>Legal Personality</li><li>Regulatory approval</li></ul>",
        "<p>These themes will be applied to various applications of AI in the sciences, which could include for example, therapeutic zoomorphic robots in aged care, surveillance systems to prevent poaching, analysis of data derived from large scale sensor deployment for measuring pedestrian flow, weather modelling, 'lab in a box', and discovery of novel materials.</p>",
        "<p>The subject is suitable for those with either science, quantitative, or legal backgrounds, with pre-class reading required both to promote the richest possible discussions during class contact time, and to address understanding of fundamental concepts for students of various backgrounds.</p>"

While every effort will be made to meet the needs of students trained in other fields, concessions will not be made in the general level of instruction or assessment. Most subjects assume the knowledge usually acquired in a degree in law (LLB, JD or equivalent). Applicants should note that admission to some subjects in the Melbourne Law Masters will be dependent upon the individual applicant\u2019s educational background and professional experience."
