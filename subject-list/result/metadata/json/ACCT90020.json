    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is intended for students interested in the study of contemporary research in management accounting, planning and control. The focus of the subject is on factors that influence the design and operation of the management control systems and the determinants of success of such systems. Research studies utilising economics and behavioural theories are examined in order to develop students' understanding of management control in an organisational context. A major part of this subject will be the development of a research proposal.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Please note that subject is only available to students admitted to the Master of Commerce (Acounting) or the Doctor of Philosophy - Business and Economics.</strong></p>"
