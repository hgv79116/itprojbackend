    "overview": [
        "<p>Although relevant for all superannuation funds, this subject focuses heavily on self-managed superannuation funds (\u2018SMSFs\u2019). This subject deals with the underlying policies, technical rules and current practical problems in relation to the taxation of SMSFs and their prudential management. In particular, it considers what investments and structures superannuation funds can use while still attracting concessional tax treatment along with how income is taxed, the treatment of contributions to those funds and the taxation of benefits paid. It also includes a detailed consideration of succession planning issues and how to apply those considerations in practice.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>The <em>Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993</em> (Cth) and the <em>Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations 1994</em> (Cth): Detailed consideration of the key investment and other prudential rules, the policy behind them and how to apply them in practice</li><li>Taxation of superannuation: overview of policy and legislative framework for contributions, investment and the payment of benefits, as well as the different structuring options available to practitioners</li><li>Succession planning: the key rules, where there often is a difference between what an SMSF member wants and what the rules allow, how best to seek to ensure that a member\u2019s wishes are achieved and the interplay with tax (including stamp duty) efficiency.</li></ul>"
