    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is designed to introduce students to case studies and analyses in the business, not-for-profit and government sectors. The objective of the subject is to provide a context in which students\u2019 knowledge of the spectrum of business and economics disciplines can be brought to bear on the various issues organisations face in pursuing their goals and objectives. Specifically, the subject will include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>The fundamentals of business cases</li><li>Learning how to break down and analyse business cases</li><li>How to develop and support a strategy</li><li>Fundamentals of group presentations and question and answer technique</li></ul>",
        "<p>Students will be presented with information by the primary course facilitators as well as by specialist (guest) speakers who will present specific information necessary to successfully analyse and present a case solution. Throughout the semester, in teams of four, students will be required to prepare up to six cases (two of which will be assessed) and present their analyses and strategies to panels of judges. Presentations will demonstrate the use of the information provided in the class. The subject will conclude with the preparation of a 24-hour case analysis and final presentation in business attire.</p>"
