In this hands-on subject, students will work together to create a class podcast.  Through this experience, they will learn how to develop content ideas, how to plan podcast series, how to structure an episode of a podcast, and how to brand and promote their work.   They will listen to longform podcasts to understand best practice and the ethics of this newly emerging genre, as well as gaining an understanding of the role that podcasts are playing in our media environment.
