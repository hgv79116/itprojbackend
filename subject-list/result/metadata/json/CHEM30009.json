        "<p>The subject includes lecture and practical components. This lecture component is based on the Inorganic Chemistry lectures from the CHEM30016 course (12 lectures) and those from an approved module relating to Inorganic Chemistry chosen from the topics offered in CHEM30017 (12 lectures). A limited selection of the following topics will be offered, from which students choose one module:<br/>\u2022 Organometallic Chemistry and Catalysis,<br/>\u2022 Metal chemistry: Principles and applications<br/>\u2022 Complex Materials and Biophysical Chemistry,<br/>\u2022 Supramolecular and Structural Inorganic Chemistry,<br/>\u2022 Metal Ions in Biology and Medicine</p>"
