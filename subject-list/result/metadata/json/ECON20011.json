    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides an economic perspective on professional sports in Australia and the rest of the world. It shows how economic concepts and theories can be used to understand the operation of professional sports, and can guide decision-making on sports by management and public policy makers. It also emphasises how studying sporting competitions can provide a laboratory for improving our knowledge of human behaviour and economic activity. Topics covered include: the demand for professional sports; the design of sporting competitions; measurement of player and team performance; strategy and decision-making in sports; sporting labour markets; managing and coaching sports teams; umpiring in sports; sports gambling markets; and national sporting performance. The subject will draw on examples from many major sports and sporting competitions \u2013 such as the Olympics, Australian Football League, cricket, soccer, National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball and National Football League (gridiron).</p>"
