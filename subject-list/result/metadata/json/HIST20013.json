        "<p>The twentieth century has been labelled the \u201cAge of Genocide\u201d. This subject will provide a detailed examination of the Holocaust, the archetype of modern genocide, as part of a broader global history of genocide and mass violence. The subject includes case studies from Europe, Africa and the Asia Pacific region. It will examine the historical origins and contested nature of the concept of genocide, as well as the contexts, mechanisms and consequences of genocidal violence through different historical experiences across the world. The genocidal context of war, ideologies of genocide, decision-making processes, victims and perpetrators, the spaces of extermination, and the processes of documentation, memorialization, legal prosecution and prevention of genocide will be studied.</p>",
        "<p>As a second level History subject, there is a focus on primary sources and document analysis. Object-based learning activities in tutorials will include working with archival materials.
