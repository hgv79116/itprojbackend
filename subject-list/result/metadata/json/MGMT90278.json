    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject focuses on an integrative approach to analysing significant supply chain strategies that organisations pursue. Using the make or buy (also known as outsourcing or insourcing) decision as a key supply chain strategy, the critical tangible and intangible factors will be analysed to form integrated frameworks for decision making purposes. Tangible factors consist of financial data, while intangible factors include risk of opportunistic behaviour, nature of resource/capability contributions, and extent of misaligned interests between supply chain partners. Key theories and case studies will be used to illustrate the significance of these factors. Examples of analytical frameworks include matrix, flowchart, or questionnaire. The importance of applying a structured and consistent approach to strategic supply chain analysis will be emphasised.</p>"
