    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject builds on the knowledge obtained in the prerequisite subject AUDI90032 Speech Pathology Practice 1. The subject expands the student\u2019s knowledge of speech pathology clinical settings and introduces the student to more complex cases. The clinical settings for this subject may include hospitals, community clinics, early intervention centres, specialist centres, schools, private practices, university clinics, nursing homes and others. Students will be allocated to placements both prior to and during semester 1. Students can anticipate a rural placement during this subject OR AUDI90039 Speech Pathology Practice 3. Students are required to financially support expenses associated with their rural placements, such as accommodation.</p>",
        "<p>A variety of clinical experiences will be offered but increasingly the student will be expected to engage with and actively participate in assessing and managing infants, children, young people and adults. In particular, the student will be expected to independently take histories, have highly developed observational skills and to use this information to be able to select the appropriate diagnostic methods and tests as per the setting, client problem, age and any other relevant variables. In addition, the student will be able to identify and differentially diagnose problems, identify co morbidity and suggest appropriate referral options. Intervention goal setting, planning and the ability to execute intervention will be developed. To support the student\u2019s learning, workshops will accompany the clinical placement experiences.</p>"
