    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject serves as an introduction to demography: the scientific study of human populations. The subject provides an overview of concepts, theories, and methodological approaches for understanding the changing patterns and determinants of population size, composition, and spatial distribution. Students will learn how components of population change \u2013 fertility, mortality, and migration \u2013 are interlinked with broader forces of development and social change in a comparative geographic perspective. Case studies will be used to discuss the socio-political and economic implications of population change in both developed and less developed regions of the world.  In doing so, the subject highlights contemporary debates and policy challenges around demographic bonus, population ageing, immigration, marriage and family change, fertility and reproductive health, gender and work, urbanisation, poverty and inequality, and population and environment.  Although the subject is non-technical, students will be introduced to online resources and tools for basic analysis and visualisation techniques of population data.</p>"
