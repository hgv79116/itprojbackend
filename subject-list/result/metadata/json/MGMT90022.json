        "<p>This subject will explore different approaches to managing organisational change. These approaches will draw on a number of different theories of change, which may include organisation development, strategic change, organisational power and politics, organisational culture, leadership, and organisational discourse theory.

The subject will also examine issues related to resistance to change and explore some of the reasons why change attempts often fail.</p>"
