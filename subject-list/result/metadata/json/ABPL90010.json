    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject investigates technological topics in building materials, components, systems and methods that normally require input from specialist trades and/or the adaptation of common practice to highly-bespoke design proposals. Focus is given to construction technologies where significant design management efforts in large and complex projects are required from the perspective of a head contractor.<br/>The subject content is reviewed each year to reflect emerging practices and challenges that affect the building industry. Topics may include: tall building construction and structural design principles, bespoke facade construction for architectural applications, hybrid construction systems and advanced technologies of manufacturing, fabrication and processes in building materials.</p>"
