    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will provide practical insights into the role of science and scientific thinking within a genuine workplace context. Students will be assigned to syndicate groups and, using a variety of techniques, they will work as a team to solve an industry-relevant problem that has been identified by their assigned Industry client. In addressing this task students will draw upon on their Environmental Science knowledge and other skills developed in the professional tools subjects they have undertaken. On commencement of the project, students will be required to spend a specific time in the business setting and to then maintain regular contact with the business, as well as the project supervisor, across the duration of the subject.</p>"
