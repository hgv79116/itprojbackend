    "overview": [
        "<p>This innovative subject is designed to explore the highly topical phenomenon of the globalisation of constitutional law. Taking the idea of legitimate authority as a focus, it examines two broad themes: (1) the extent to which national constitutional law is, or should be, converging on international standards; and (2) the extent to which international institutions are, or should be, influenced by standards of a constitutional kind. Under theme (1) it examines whether the constitutions of the world are, or ought to be, converging towards a point at which it will be possible to identify constitutional standards that apply within each state, with implications for the legitimacy of each constitutional order. Under theme (2) it examines the constitutional standards that properly apply to legitimate international legal institutions, e.g. Security Council, International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Bringing the two themes together, the subject concludes by examining the prospects of a global constitutional court tasked with upholding a global constitutional minimum. The two lecturers in the subject bring different bodies of expertise to bear on these challenging issues. Laureate Professor Cheryl Saunders works in the field of global comparative constitutional law; Professor John Tasioulas is a legal philosopher, whose work focuses on international law.</p>",
