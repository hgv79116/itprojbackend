        "<p>Formal logic and discrete mathematics provide the theoretical foundations for computer science. This subject uses logic and discrete mathematics to model the science of computing. It provides a grounding in the theories of logic, sets, relations, functions, automata, formal languages, and computability, providing concepts that underpin virtually all the practical tools contributed by the discipline, for automated storage, retrieval, manipulation and communication of data.<br/><br/><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT</strong></p>",
        "<ul><li>Logic: Propositional and predicate logic, resolution proofs, mathematical proof</li><li>Discrete mathematics: Sets, functions, relations, order, well-foundedness, induction and recursion</li><li>Automata: Regular languages, finite-state automata, context-free grammars and languages, parsing</li><li>Computability briefly: Turing machines, computability, decidability</li></ul>",
