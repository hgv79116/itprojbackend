    "overview": [
        "<p>Cities are increasingly where the majority of the global population lives but also where some of the starkest issues of inequality, environmental degradation, and social conflict occurs. This subject uses tools from social policy to address intractable problems related to urban life. It gives students conceptual tools to grapple with social policy issues that are urban in nature, and it deals with city spaces and municipal governance. It offers an introduction to issues such as social problems connected to housing affordability, conflicts over neighbourhood spaces, addiction and recovery, homelessness, workforce mobility and commuting, and non-profit service providers in high density areas, to name a few. Students will enhance both their analytical comprehension of the intersection between urban planning and social policy as well as their practical skills as practitioners in this space within non-profit institutions and local government. </p>"
