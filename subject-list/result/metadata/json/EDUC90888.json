    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will develop Teacher Candidates\u2019 practical understanding of how the Arts can be applied in the primary classroom. Teacher Candidates will link studio practice to relevant theory and school experience to formulate a rationale for their emerging arts pedagogy. Studio time will involve practical arts making which emphasises content, skills, knowledge and resources for teaching both within the discrete arts disciplines, and for applying the Arts <em>across</em> the curriculum. Teacher Candidates will engage with the individual Drama, Music and Visual Arts components of the <em>Victorian Curriculum</em>, investigating their application (in and across artforms) in the classroom and whole school programs. Emphasis will be given to building awareness of avenues for continued professional learning in the arts.</p>"
