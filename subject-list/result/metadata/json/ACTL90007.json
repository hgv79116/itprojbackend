    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides the groundwork for the capstone subject Life Contingencies. It provides students with a framework for actuarial modelling. The subject also expands students\u2019 existing knowledge of mortality modelling by introducing the important ideas of mortality variation in a population and selection effects, which have implications for the applied topic of pricing life insurance products. Building on this, models used for mortality projections and forecasting, and elementary principles of machine learning are provided.</p>"
