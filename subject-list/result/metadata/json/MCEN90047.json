        "<p>This subject will cover the aerodynamics and thermodynamics of aircraft gas turbines and rockets and provide the tools to design and evaluate the performance of jet engines. <strong>It will also present the current environmental impacts of aviation and paths for more sustainable aviation.</strong></p>",
        "<p>Topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Understanding the requirements and background of jet engines, in particular how the requirements translate to the design of an engine.</li><li>An overview of the key aerodynamical aspects of aircraft relevant to the propulsion system and how jet engines create thrust.</li><li>Engine performance parameters. These are discussed in the context of thermal, cycle and propulsive efficiencies.</li><li>Principles and layouts of jet engines. Different classes of engines will be looked at, such as turbojets, turbofans, and bypass ratios, turbine inlet temperature will be discussed.</li><li>Fundamentals of compressible flow relevant to jet engines will be discussed, including stagnation quantities and choked nozzles.</li><li>Dimensional analysis and non-dimensional variables of engines.</li><li>How to configure compressors and turbines, with consideration of blade profiles, flow coefficient, cooling and losses.</li><li><strong>Environmental impacts of aviation and challenges and strategies for more sustainable aviation.</strong></li><li>Rocket propulsion: what are the performance parameters and what are the benefits of staging?</li></ul>"
