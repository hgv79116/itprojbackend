        "<p>Australia has introduced the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). The NDIS represents a fundamental social change in the provision of disability support services. This change places the consumer at the centre of service delivery. This subject will explore the introduction of the NDIS, exploring why this change was implemented, how it is being used by consumers and their families, and different service arrangements that are emerging as private, not for profit and public agencies seek to meet the needs of people with disabilities across the life span. </p>"
