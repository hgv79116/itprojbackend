        "<p><strong>AIMS</strong></p>",
        "<p>The subject will explore foundational knowledge in the area of cryptography and information security. The overall aim is to gain an understanding of fundamental cryptographic concepts like encryption and signatures and use it to build and analyse security in computers, communications and networks. This subject covers fundamental concepts in information security on the basis of methods of modern cryptography, including encryption, signatures and hash functions.</p>",
        "<p>This subject is an elective subject in the Master of Engineering (Software). It can also be taken as an advanced elective in Master of Information Technology.</p>",
        "<p><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT<br/></strong></p>",
        "<p>The subject will be made up of three parts:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Cryptography: the essentials of public and private key cryptography, stream ciphers, digital signatures and cryptographic hash functions</li><li>Access Control: the essential elements of authentication and authorization; and</li><li>Secure Protocols; which are obtained through cryptographic techniques.</li></ul>",
        "<p>A particular emphasis will be placed on real-life protocols such as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Kerberos.<strong> <br/></strong></p>",
        "<p>Topics drawn from:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Symmetric key crypto systems</li><li>Public key cryptosystems</li><li>Hash functions</li><li>Authentication</li><li>Secret sharing</li><li>Protocols</li><li>Key Management.</li></ul>"
