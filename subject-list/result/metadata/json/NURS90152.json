    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides the theoretical knowledge for specialty practice in critical care. Students will extend their knowledge from Applied Pathophysiology and Foundations in Critical Care Nursing to understand acute and complex illnesses and disease in patients who are critically ill requiring complex care management. Students will gain essential knowledge to assess, plan, manage and evaluate interventions. Patient and family perspectives of illness will be considered in the development and implementation of multi-disciplinary care planning.</p>"
