    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will focus on translational genomics in public health and the community. Community engagement and education strategies will be considered using current workforce examples, with attention to cultural competence, education in the field of genomics and communication about genomics. The role of personalised genomics and precision medicine will also be explored, using examples of emerging treatments for a variety of genetic conditions. </p>",
        "<p>The subject will be delivered via a combination of asynchronous on-line content and synchronous tutorials that adopt a problem-based approach to meet the intended learning outcomes.</p>"
