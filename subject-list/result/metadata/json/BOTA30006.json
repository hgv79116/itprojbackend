        "<p>This subject is structured around the fieldwork in early February and covers the basic skills that are required to undertake a field-based botanical activity such as a flora survey or an environmental impact assessment, or to proceed to research in a field-based botanical discipline. Topics to be covered include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>taxonomy of the Australian flora;</li><li>field identification of major families and genera of plants;</li><li>collection and preservation of plant specimens; mounting and cataloguing specimens; curatorial skills; nomenclature;</li><li>techniques for description and classification of vegetation; structural types, floristic associations, measures of abundance (cover, density, basal area, biomass), sampling techniques (quadrats, line transects, plotless methods), sampling scale and species-area relationships, profile diagrams, life-form spectra;</li><li>soils; and</li><li>vegetation mapping.</li></ul>"
