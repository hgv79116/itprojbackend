        "<p>From self-driving cars to automatic processing of medical scans, vision is a key sensory modality for a variety of artificial intelligence tasks. However, extracting meaning from images poses various computational challenges. In this subject, students will learn the basic principles of image formation and computational methods for interpreting images. Students will develop an understanding of the standard frameworks used in computer vision algorithms and their applications in tasks such as object recognition, target detection, and three-dimensional reconstruction. The programming language used is Python.</p>",
