    "overview": [
        "<p>The theory of statistical inference is important for applied statistics and as a discipline in its own right. After reviewing random samples and related probability techniques including inequalities and convergence concepts the theory of statistical inference is developed. The principles of data reduction are discussed and related to model development. Methods of finding estimators are given, with an emphasis on multi-parameter models, along with the theory of hypothesis testing and interval estimation. Both finite and large sample properties of estimators are considered. Applications may include robust and distribution free methods, quasi-likelihood and generalized estimating equations. It is expected that students completing this course will have the tools to be able to develop inference procedures in novel settings.</p>"
