        "<p><strong>AIMS</strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject gives students in the Master of Engineering (Software) their first experience in analysing, designing, implementing, managing and delivering a small software engineering project. The aim of the subject is to give students an understanding of the major phases of software development, what each phase requires and how that phase fits into the overall engineering process. The subject also aims to give students an understanding of the importance of analysis, design, quality assurance activities and management activities within a software engineering process and to underpin the practical aspects of the management, analysis, design and validation subjects within the degree.</p>",
        "<p><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT<br/></strong></p>",
        "<p>Students will work in teams to conceive, analyse, design, implement and test a non-trivial software system for an external client. A key part of the project is for students to develop and manage a repeatable process in order to deliver a quality software product Workshops will explore the application of theory to your project and include selected topics drawn from: requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing and software project management relevant to the phase of the project that students are currently working on.</p>",
        "<p>This subject has been integrated with the Skills Towards Employment Program (STEP) and contains activities that can assist in the completion of the Engineering Practice Hurdle (EPH).</p>",
