        "<p>\u201cFeminism is for everybody\u201d! \u201cMen have no place on the women\u2019s march!\u201d. \"If your feminism isn\u2019t intersectional, it\u2019s bullshit!\u201d \u201cIt is not the job of feminism to care about all injustice everywhere!\u201d. \u201cFeminism is about women\u2019s equality with men!\u201d. \u201cFeminism isn\u2019t about equality with men, it\u2019s about women\u2019s liberation from what men have created!\u201d These are all familiar claims, and yet they pull in completely different directions. What is feminism? Who is it for? Can men be feminists? What is intersectionality, and must feminism be intersectional? What are the orthodoxies of mainstream feminism, and do they hold up under scrutiny? In this subject we\u2019ll critically consider a range of feminist arguments (with an emphasis on second wave feminism). We\u2019ll also consider a range of applied topics like prostitution, surrogacy, inclusion of transwomen, beauty norms, and feminist tactics.</p>"
