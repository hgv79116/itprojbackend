    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is concerned with the modelling and analysis of vibrating systems. It provides tools to analyse a range of systems in which vibration occurs, including the vibration of systems in which aerodynamic forces are also important (aeroelasticity).</p>",
        "<p>The topics covered in this subject are:</p>",
        "<p>The vibration of a single mass-spring-damper system. This will include the calculation of its natural frequency, its free vibration, and its response to forcing.</p>",
        "<p>The vibration of mass-spring-damper systems with multiple degrees of freedom. This will include calculation of the system\u2019s natural frequencies and mode shapes, its free vibration, and its response to forcing.</p>",
        "<p>The vibration of continuous systems in engineering applications. This will include the vibration of strings and beams (for which there is one spatial dimension); and the vibration of membranes and plates (for which there are two spatial dimensions).</p>",
        "<p>Aeroelasticity and its relevance in aerospace applications. We will consider the simultaneous influences of mass, stiffness and aerodynamic forces and how they can combine to give rise to aeroelastic phenomena. We will look in particular at the conditions under which i) divergence and ii) flutter can occur.</p>"
