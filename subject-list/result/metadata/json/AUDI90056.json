    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject allows students to consolidate the knowledge developed in Professionalism and Clinical Processes A in the context of their developing clinical audiology skills. Reflective practice underpins all elements of this subject. On completion of the subject, students will have further developed and be able to demonstrate their reflective practice skills in clinical environments and on clinically-relevant topics. They will be aware of and be able to describe the overlap between hearing and balance health outcomes in the context of the individual and their community. They will also be able to critically reflect on and describe their own future growth requirements for clinical practice.</p>"
