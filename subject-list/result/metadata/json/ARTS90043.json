    "overview": [
        "<p>Translation is a fundamental tool for academic research. The dissemination and exchange of knowledge across cultures is often made possible through translation. Current academic scholarship tends to accept translations uncritically, disregarding the highly varied and in some cases conflicting translative practices. This subject explores such practices and the theories underpinning them by looking at the modern and contemporary thinkers (Montaigne, Foucault, and Derrida to mention a few) who addressed the ethical, cultural and political implications behind current academic uses of translation. At the end of this subject students will acquire a more critical and nuanced understanding of the transmission and reception of cultural texts.</p>"
