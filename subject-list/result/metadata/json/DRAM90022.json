    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject focuses on the application of a directorial practice rooted in close productive collaboration with artists from disciplines that are key to a director\u2019s creative team \u2013 such as actors, designers, choreographers, dramaturgs and writers.</p>",
        "<p>The subject is delivered through a variety of practical workshops, intensives and collaborative projects with students from other theatre courses (e.g. actors, writers, dramaturgs, etc.) or from other disciplines such as dance, film, music theatre or production. The projects may range in scale from table work to scene studies and full productions, with a focus on the development and application of a directorial practice that is flexible, responsive, with strong ethical grounding.</p>",
        "<p>You will work alongside acting students in weekly workshops in order to gain practical knowhow of actors\u2019 processes of developing a role; in collaboration with playwrights and dramaturgs in writing workshops, enabling the acquisition of skills in the generation and direction of new performance texts; and in hands-on laboratory classes with students and industry professionals from disciplines such as dance, design, composition and visual arts in order to develop embodied understanding of interdisciplinary collaboration and performance making.</p>"
