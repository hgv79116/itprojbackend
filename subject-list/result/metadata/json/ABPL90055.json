    "overview": [
        "<p>Many Asia-Pacific cities have undergone rapid urban development and change as they have become integrated into the global economy. The character of that integration has changed over time; at the same time social and political aspirations have been expressed in new demands for services and housing. This course will explore the urban planning implications of these changes in a city. It begins with a review of the global and local forces that have generated change in Asia-Pacific cities. This section will isolate key features for further investigation. These selected features will then be explored in ten days in the selected Pacific Asian city through a series of lectures, field inspections and field work. A third part of the course, involving seminar discussion, will be followed by report writing on planning issues in the selected city.</p>",
