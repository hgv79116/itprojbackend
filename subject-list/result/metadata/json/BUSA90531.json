        "<p>Over the past decade, there has been a growing demand for big data and analytics in business and public organisations. As society is moving towards to a \u201cbig data world\u201d, there is growing interest for analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence. While not every manager is going to become a data analyst, the broader spectrum of general managers still needs to understand how they can use the power of analytics to improve their firm\u2019s business performance. In essence, they need to understand what analytics can, and cannot do in terms of contributing to the development of a better and more sustainable overall strategy for their firm. This subject addresses the strategic management issues related to the fast-moving big data world from the general manager\u2019 perspective, as opposed to the data scientist\u2019s perspective.</p>"
