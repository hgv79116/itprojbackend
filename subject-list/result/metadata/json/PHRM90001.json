    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject addresses the fundamental pharmacological principles of medication management, which enables students to develop and utilise skills for specialty practice. Students will learn foundational knowledge of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and therapeutics, in order to understand the actions of drugs on physiological, biochemical and pathophysiological processes.</p>",
        "<p>With a greater appreciation of the mechanisms of actions of drugs on body processes, students will be able to determine the therapeutic, adverse effects, contraindications and precautions for use for the specialty practice setting. Key pharmacological characteristics of drug classes will be emphasised, rather than characteristics associated with individual agents.</p>",
        "<p>This focus encourages students to develop life long learning skills that will enable them to assess patients' needs for specific medications, administer medications, monitor responses to medications and evaluate outcomes in their practice setting. Please note that this subject is conducted through the Department of Pharmacology.</p>"
