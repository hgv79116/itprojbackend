    "overview": [
        "<p>The exploitation of mineral and petroleum resources involves substantial risk. The resources joint venture provides a commercial opportunity to manage this risk. It is a particular legal relationship: an association of persons (natural or corporate) to engage in a common undertaking to generate a product to be shared among the participants. Management of the undertaking is divided: the participants determine some matters by agreement at the outset of the relationship; the power to determine other matters is vested in a committee on which the participants are represented and entitled to vote; a manager (or operator) is appointed by the participants to conduct agreed activities, on their behalf, within the scope of the common undertaking (exploration, development production).</p>",
        "<p>This subject examines the legal issues involved in this complex relationship, together with ancillary transactions (such as farmouts). In doing so, it considers the capacity of the common law to respond to commercial imperatives. It also evaluates the effectiveness of legal documentation employed in establishing the joint venture relationship.</p>",
        "<p>The lecturer, a former Dean of Melbourne Law School, has published extensively in the fields of energy and resources law and served as President of the Australian Mineral and Petroleum Law Association.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Statutory titles, government agreements and production-sharing agreements</li><li>Farmouts</li><li>Joint ventures and operations</li><li>Unit development</li><li>The operator/manager</li><li>Fundamentals of contract law and property law</li><li>Assignment</li><li>Liability</li><li>Default</li><li>Disclosure and confidentiality</li><li>Sole risk</li><li>Termination</li><li>Codification.</li></ul>"
