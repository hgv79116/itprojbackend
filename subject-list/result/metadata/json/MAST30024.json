    "overview": [
        "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This subject introduces three areas of geometry that play a key role in many branches of mathematics and physics. In differential geometry, calculus and the concept of curvature will be used to study the shape of curves and surfaces. In topology, geometric properties that are unchanged by continuous deformations will be studied to find a topological classification of surfaces. In algebraic geometry, curves defined by polynomial equations will be explored. Remarkable connections between these areas will be discussed.</p>",
        "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Topics include: Topological classification of surfaces, Euler characteristic, orientability.Introduction to the differential geometry of surfaces in Euclidean space:smooth surfaces, tangent planes, length of curves, Riemannian metrics, Gaussian curvature, minimal surfaces, Gauss-Bonnet theorem.Complex algebraic curves, including conics and cubics, genus.</p>"
