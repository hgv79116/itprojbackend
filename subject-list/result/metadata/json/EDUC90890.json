    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject examines the theoretical perspectives on physical, personal, social, emotional, cognitive and spiritual aspects of early childhood development and learning, with an emphasis on the age range 3 \u2013 8 years. Teacher Candidates will explore the range of factors affecting the development, learning and wellbeing of young children across the age range three to eight years. Teacher Candidates will examine the relationship of development and learning, with a focus on the developing brain and the significance of early relationships and wellbeing for learning. Content includes the learning processes being established in children\u2019s (3-8 years) development, such as regulation, memory, attention, curiosity, and gathering information. Teacher Candidates will explore children\u2019s (3-8 years) positioning in family, friend and community networks and the range of factors contributing to young children\u2019s learning and development, emphasising agency, social connectedness, and transitions across diverse educational contexts. Links will be made between children\u2019s learning and development and the VEYLDF and Victorian Curriculum. Topics will include: learning and development across diverse contexts, factors of identity, wellbeing and social connectedness; understanding the legislative requirements and working within approved learning and regulatory frameworks to meet the development and learning needs of all children.</p>"
