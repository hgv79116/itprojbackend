        "<p>What does it take to develop something innovative and then move it from the laboratory out into the real world? Scientists must negotiate a labyrinth of hurdles, ranging from conducting bullet-proof data analysis, designing clinical trials, developing and managing intellectual property, assessing contracts, and setting up Total Quality Management systems in a biotech setting. Students will learn how to navigate these hurdles as applied to a range of possible inventions, such as therapeutics, diagnostics, medical devices, GMOs and other bio-science-related creations.</p>"
