    "overview": [
        "<p>In this subject, students undertake a program of original research in one of the many research fields in which the School of Physics is active and internationally recognised: astrophysics, condensed matter physics, optics, and particle physics. The research may be experimental and/or theoretical in nature. It will be conducted under the supervision of a member of the Schools academic staff. The results will be reported in the form of a thesis. Students enrol in a total of 50 points of research project across the duration of the Graduate Diploma in Science (Advanced) program. This is achieved by enrolling in two of subjects across two consecutive semesters to achieve a total 50 credit points. Students enrol in a Part 1 subject in the first semester and a Part 2 subject in the second semester of the program.</p>",
        "<p>This subject (PHYC40014 Physics Research Project Pt 2) is a 25 points version for one semester.</p>"
