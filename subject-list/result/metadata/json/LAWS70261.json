        "<p>Design plays a critical role in the production and marketing of goods. Adequate protection of designs is important in order to encourage the creation of innovative products and thus enhance the Australian and New Zealand economies. This subject is primarily concerned with the laws in both countries. It will focus first on the registered regimes for protecting designs under the <em>Designs Act 2003</em> (Cth), as well as the protection of designs as original artistic works under the <em>Copyright Act 1968</em> (Cth). It will then deal with the differences of law and practice that arise under the <em>Designs Act 1953 </em>(NZ) and the <em>Copyright Act 1994 </em>(NZ).</p>",
