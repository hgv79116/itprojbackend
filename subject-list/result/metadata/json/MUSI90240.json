        "<p>This subject prepares students to design and implement curriculum relevant to the needs of diverse music learners, such as those with neurodevelopmental conditions and learning differences. This subject focuses on translating theory into practice through developing skills in creating learning opportunities that are inclusive and supportive of diverse learners. Intensive teaching will provide students with interactive learning tasks that aim to develop skills in critical reflection on success of curriculum design. Classes will therefore focus on professional development and experiential group learning.</p>"
