        "<p>Law is arguably central to the articulation of theories about rights and justice. It is also the foundation for establishment and functioning of the institutions and practices which give practical effect to notions of legal and judicial justice and define the rights enjoyed by citizens. This subject examines the dynamic relationship between law, justice and rights in China. This subject adopts socio-legal and comparative perspectives to examine the role of the state and law in articulating notions of justice and rights. China is an example of a powerful, developing, 'post socialist' country where administration of justice and the protection of rights and justice are often viewed as competing with the state's priorities of social and political stability and economic development.</p>",
        "<p>Topics addressed will include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>The relationship between international and domestic human rights laws and norms in China;</li><li>Law, policy and reforms in China in the areas of social and economic rights such as property, housing, health and labour;</li><li>The administration of criminal and administrative justice and the role of different state and non state actors in defining and protecting rights both in China and in comparison with some recent reforms in other countries in the Asian region;</li><li>The role of Chinese and foreign NGOs in advocacy in areas such as environmental protection, health and harm reduction; and</li><li>Conceptual and institutional limits on the role of law in defining and protecting rights and justice in China.</li></ul>",
