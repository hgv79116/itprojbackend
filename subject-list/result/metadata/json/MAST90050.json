        "<p>Scheduling is critical to manufacturing, mining, and logistics, and is of increasing importance in healthcare and service industries. Most automated systems, ranging from elevators to industrial robots, embed some kind of scheduling algorithms. Building on the Optimisation background provided in Optimisation for Industry, this subject teaches students how to solve more advanced problems. A particular focus will be scheduling problems, but other more general assignment problems will be discussed.</p>"
