    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces the essential features of Operations Research methods, and also introduces the area of Discrete Mathematics with a focus on applications. Operations Research topics include mathematical modelling, linear programming, simplex methods, and duality theory. Discrete Mathematics topics include scheduling, graph theory, assignments and matchings, and fair division. The subject material has a common theme of applications of mathematics in realistic settings encountered in the business world, industry and day-to-day life.</p>"
