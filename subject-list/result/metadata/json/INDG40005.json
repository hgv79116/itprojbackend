    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject aims to support students undertaking research in Indigenous histories in their Honours year. It will provide students with a foundation of knowing how to be able to work safely and sensitively to produce Indigenous History. The aim of the subject is to support students to write histories that are culturally safe for Indigenous people to read and support the development of a nuanced appreciation of Indigenous life and Australian colonialism. We will offer both access to knowledge and practical strategies to support students to write histories that are aware of the complexities and implications of Indigenous history as a field of study.</p>",
        "<p>The subject foregrounds concepts of relationality as the basis for the development of engaged histories. It will support students to reflect on their subject position and their relationship to historical and contemporary colonialism in Australia. Taught by Indigenous and non-Indigenous staff working together, this subject will model processes of reflexivity and allow the exploration of complex concepts as a group.</p>"
