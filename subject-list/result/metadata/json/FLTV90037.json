        "<p>In this subject, students will work collaboratively on a second graduate production in a selected genre on a narrative, documentary or animation short film, acting in a senior production role such as co-producer, line producer or production manager.</p>",
        "<p>Students will research and analyse the production processes relevant to their role, formally documenting their experiences.</p>",
        "<p>Students will critically assess the mechanisms and strategies for dealing with production-based challenges and interpersonal dynamics that arise in creating screen work. Self-reflection and evaluation of one's own and others' performance will enable recognition of alternative strategies, processes of improvement and critical evaluation of the producing and production process.</p>",

Students are required to enrol in FLTV90037 Production Collaboration 2 Part 1 (6.25 points) and FLTV90040 Production Collaboration 2 Part 2 (6.25 points), consecutively, for a total enrolment of 12.5 points.</em></p>",
