    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject investigates the nature of student engagement in order to support the creative work of teachers in bringing students and curriculum together in meaningful encounter. Special emphasis is placed on comprehending and building teacher\u2019s knowledge of those they teach: who these people are (their ways of being), how they change/learn (becoming), and how this knowledge and experience, often downplayed, contributes to the creative task of teaching. Such knowledge is employed to inform the design task of unit planning as this articulates the broader expectations for who the students are asked to be through the unit, as well as the learning activities and content. Unit planning is also positioned as defining the educational \u2018space\u2019 which contextualizes the specific clinical interventions that a teacher designs and performs.</p>"
