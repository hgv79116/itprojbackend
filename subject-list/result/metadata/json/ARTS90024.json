        "<p>This subject consists of two components: 1) Industry Core and 2) Placement.</p>",
        "<p>For the Industry Core classroom component, students will participate in a series of seminars that examine current trends in the cultural and creative industries. As part of the classroom component, students will also conduct original research on an approved topic selected in consultation with the subject coordinator. The research project will be in the field of arts and cultural management as applied to a single art form or cross-art form projects such as festivals, multimedia projects or international exchange in the arts and will draw on theoretical literature.</p>",
        "<p>For the placement component, students will be assisted to find a placement in a professional working environment where they will gain direct exposure to professional practice in their chosen field. They will work under the guidance of a senior staff member, with additional support from the subject coordinator. Students will be required to complete 150 hours of on-site work experience to fulfil this component of the subject.</p>"
