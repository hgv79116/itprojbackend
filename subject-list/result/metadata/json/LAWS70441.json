    "overview": [
        "<p>Construction industry personnel and their lawyers are increasingly aware of the need to anticipate the legal implications of communication and \u2018issue management\u2019 throughout the project life cycle. Therefore, this subject aims to equip industry professionals and lawyers with the skills necessary to identify and proactively manage legal risk during the procurement and delivery phases. Complementing other subjects within Melbourne Law School\u2019s construction law program that examine legal risks and their management, this subject provides practical insights into key aspects of the legal/project interface, including tendering and contract preparation procedures that efficiently \u2018document the deal\u2019 and contract administration techniques that minimise disputation.</p>"
