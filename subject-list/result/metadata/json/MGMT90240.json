    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject examines the rise of the new information technologies within a wider organisational, social and historical context. It relates them to the emergence of \"information-based\" societies, where work, organisations and society are said to be changing fundamentally. In particular, it examines some of the competing claims made about such developments and examines the actual impacts of new information technologies on a range of issues that may include work organisation and behaviour, culture, power and knowledge. It also looks at the broader social and ethical implications for the wider society and globalisation within an increasingly globalized and marketised world.</p>"
