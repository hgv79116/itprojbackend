    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will require students to apply foundation clinical care skills including risk assessment, genetic testing, variant interpretation and analysis, to demonstrate how cases in core genomic specialty areas are managed.  The role of personalised genomics and precision medicine will also be explored, using examples of emerging treatments for a variety of genetic conditions. </p>",
        "<p>The intended learning outcomes for this subject are in accordance with the Human Genetics Society of Australasia\u2019s core competencies for training in genetic counselling. The subject will be delivered via a combination of asynchronous on-line content and synchronous tutorials that adopt a problem-based approach to meet the intended learning outcomes.</p>"
