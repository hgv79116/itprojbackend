    "overview": [
        "<p>Wakanda is a subject concentrated on pressing issues of our time and the future including Afrofuturisms and resilience, Black migration and/in education, living in diasporic spaces, memories and histories, surviving race and racism, African philosophies and modes of social engagement. The subject offers ways to build your knowledge capacity to understand, responsibly engage, act, and create within spaces of Blackness in schools, neighbourhoods, industries, and communities. Through its intensive delivery and conceptual and experiential depth of knowledge, you will have the opportunity to draw paths of action whether you are an undergraduate (e.g. planning on working alongside African Australian members of our society), an educator (e.g. through thinking or designing curriculum), or a community leader and organizer (e.g. intending to enrich your work and practice).</p>",
        "<p>This dynamically designed subject will move through four portals of knowledge creation, 1) reading conceptually grounded texts and watching popular culture materials, 2) the oral tradition in the form of lectures delivered by world renown scholars/elders from the Americas, the Caribbean, Africa and Australia, 3) meditations, conversations, and discussion with local African Australian youth from our very communities, and 4) creating and making spaces for planning and producing action relevant to your degree, circumstances, and experiences.</p>",
        "<p>This subject is designed for graduate and undergraduate students. It is available to study abroad/exchanges students, and members of the community can also take the subject as a Community Access Program enrolment.</p>"
