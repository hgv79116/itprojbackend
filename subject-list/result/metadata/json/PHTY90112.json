    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject aims to provide opportunities for students to engage with more advanced levels of musculoskeletal physiotherapy practice with a particular emphasis on manual therapy and sports physiotherapy. Advanced practice in this subject is inclusive of critical reasoning, differential assessment and intervention selection that are informed by contemporary evidence. Students will have the opportunity to advance and build on the following skills: differential assessment, critical evaluation and decision making; selection and execution of appropriate treatment techniques, evaluation of treatment effectiveness and treatment modification and progression as necessary. Students will also develop an enhanced understanding of the role of a physiotherapist in a multi-disciplinary clinical setting within a primary contact environment. Advanced practice will also incorporate the identification, appraisal, synthesis and application of research evidence underpinning specific areas of musculoskeletal physiotherapy practice.</p>"
