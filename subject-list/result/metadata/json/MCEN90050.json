    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides a project-based learning experience to design and develop a proof-of-concept prototype mechanical device that addresses a need for a person living with disability. Projects are defined by real-life challenges provided by people with a lived experience of disability who also help mentor teams. The goal is to engage in human-centred design thinking that is socially, technically and financially sensible and that delivers products that are feasible, desirable and viable. Topics covered include human-centred design principles, the design thinking approach to problem solving, life as a person with disability and engineering ethics.</p>"
