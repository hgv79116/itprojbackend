    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject allows students to fine tune their language skills by engaging with the heterogenous and diverse cultures, events, ideas, and experiences of the Spanish-Speaking world. Designed as a primer for students interested in learning more about the histories and cultures of Spain and Latin America, students will sharpen their skills in listening, speaking, reading, writing and research through an integrative learning experience that involves using the Spanish language to critically examine key cultural texts from the Hispanic world.<br/><br/>Cultural texts studied may include films, literature, art works, propaganda and/or archived ephemera, which act as catalysts for discussion, critical thinking and insight. Texts analysed and discussed in this subject relate to issues and events of historical and political significance, while touching on shared cultural themes.<br/><br/>Through a close reading of Spanish-speaking cultural products of various kinds, students will develop an appreciation for the particular powers of each mode of representation. This subject also introduces students to basic research methods in Hispanic Cultural Studies, such as archival work, translation, and the selection and study of primary and secondary sources.</p>"
