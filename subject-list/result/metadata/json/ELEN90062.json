        "<p>The aim of the subject is to provide theoretical and practical treatment of high-speed electronics. Through the subject, students will grasp the fundamental properties and models of high-speed signals and interconnects, acquire high-speed digital design skills with a focus on the modelling, analysis, design and application of high speed transistors, logic gates and modern logic families, and master the high-speed analogue design capability including the design of oscillators and filters for RF applications. The students will be exposed to the state-of-the-art technologies that are shaping the fast evolving semiconductor industry<strong>.<br/><br/>INDICATIVE CONTENT<br/></strong></p>",
        "<p>The topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Fundamental properties of analogue systems;</li><li>Smith charts: principles and applications;</li><li>High-speed analogue circuits: voltage control oscillators, matching networks, and low noise amplifiers;</li><li>Bipolar junction transistors: device, switching, and logic;</li><li>CMOS: device, switching and logic;</li><li>High-speed signalling consideration: power dissipation, heat, signal propagation, and termination.</li></ul>"
