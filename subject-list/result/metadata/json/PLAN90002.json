    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will introduce students to the range of perspectives on urban planning systems and cultures offered by different disciplines. In a first half, political science, geography, history, business and urban planning disciplinary approaches to the aims and methods of comparison of urban planning systems will be examined.  In the second half of the subject, a series of case studies of the main features and legal basis of different national planning systems and cultures of particular nations will be presented depending on staff availability and expertise. These national case studies are intended to illustrate the contrasts that exist in planning systems and cultures across the global north and south. The subject is intended as the basis from which to explore the other subjects available in this specialization.</p>"
