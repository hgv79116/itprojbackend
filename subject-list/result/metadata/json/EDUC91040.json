Participants will use this content focus to consider the role of the nature of science in students\u2019   understanding of science and investigate a range of frameworks for developing students\u2019 understanding of the nature of science and developing science reasoning skills.</p>",
        "<p>In this final subject, participants will also consider a range of methods and issues for moving beyond a siloed approach to teaching science. Frameworks for integrating subjects and examples of integrated topics will be critically evaluated by the participants. These ideas will also be used to consider the place of STEM in the school curriculum.</p>"
