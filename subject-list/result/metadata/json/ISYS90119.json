        "<p>This subject provides final semester Master of Information Systems (MIS) students with the opportunity to undertake an industry-based project to demonstrate and apply their knowledge and skills in Information Systems. Students will work in a group of four to solve specific problems experienced by their industry client. Each group will be allocated an academic mentor.<br/>The subject involves in-depth investigations of a business problem in the real world and the proposal of a solution that may involve information systems and/or business process reengineering. The proposed solution should offer economic, environmental, and social benefits to the client organisation and their stakeholders. Typical project tasks include defining project requirements, researching relevant literature, designing, and evaluating a solution, and communicating project outcomes to the industry client, practitioners, academics, and the general public.<br/>While undertaking the project, students will need to demonstrate an understanding of IS professional practice, ethical conduct, and sustainability considerations.</p>",
