    "overview": [
        "<p>This is a wide-ranging subject that will consider the modern origins of economic competition theory, its interrelation with international trade, the historical development of national competition law regimes, and how competition law and policy have been affected by geopolitical shifts over time. Students will learn about the ways in which competition authorities cooperate with each other and the roles played by regional and international organisations and networks. They will also investigate how small and developing countries have reacted to the pressures of globalisation with regard to competition issues and the challenges they face. The digital economy and its significant effects in the global marketplace and competition will also be examined. Finally, the subject will look at how globalisation and the increasingly transnational nature of commerce has affected the practice of competition law.</p>",
        "<p>Highlights of the subject include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Exploration and critique of the ways in which governments and competition authorities are seeking to meet the challenges posed by anti-competitive conduct that has multi-jurisdictional effects</li><li>Critical examination of how tensions between considerations of national sovereignty and international comity arise in the competition law context</li><li>Special focus on the increasing significance of competition policy, law, and enforcement in international trade and regulation and the implications for small and developing economies</li><li>Special focus on the challenges faced by competition authorities in technology sectors and the digital economy more broadly</li><li>Consideration of the strategic opportunities and challenges for multinational business organisations in managing competition law risks</li><li>Insights and perspectives from leading stakeholders such as competition authority officials and practitioners to assist students in grappling with the challenges posed by the design and application of competition policies and rules in cross-border settings</li></ul>"
