        "<p>Students will establish a sizeable concert repertory covering a wide range of styles and demonstrate their ability to perform with confidence and excellence. Areas to be covered include consolidation of instrumental or vocal technique with the projection of structural balance, and specialisation in all related aspects of music performance. Formative feedback in individual and group settings will be provided across the semester.</p>",
        "<p>In order to contextualise their education within the best practices of local, national and international standards, students are expected to work competently and productively both alone and in groups. The subject involves participation in individual lessons, instrument/voice classes, performance class and/or assigned ensemble activities. In order to ensure the highest level of performance preparation, 100% attendance is expected.</p>",
