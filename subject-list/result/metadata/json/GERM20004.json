    "overview": [
        "<p>In this subject students extend their German competencies in writing, reading, speaking and listening by engaging with authentic texts and situations on the theme of \u201cGender\u201d. We explore gender as a linguistic, social and cultural phenomenon in modern and contemporary German-speaking societies. Students will engage with the complexity of authentic texts such as film and television, literature, song and conventional and social media. Students will learn to communicate at a more sophisticated level, going beyond utterances focused exclusively on the self, and developing structures and vocabulary that enable them to express themselves in the context of broader social and cultural themes. Students will move towards a moderate level of complexity in speaking, aural comprehension, reading and writing of German and a familiarity with the linguistic and socio-cultural dimensions of gender. </p>"
