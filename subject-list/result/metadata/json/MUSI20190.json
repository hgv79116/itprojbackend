        "<p><strong>This subject has been designed and developed for online delivery and assessment only.</strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject builds on the basics of sound recording presented in The Laptop Recording Studio. Aspects of sound recording including microphone use, mixing, ensemble/band and solo recording, acoustics, recording set up and editing will be examined.</p>",
        "<p>Advanced Recording Studio Techniques is delivered fully online in a workshop environment and will practically illuminate the fundamental and advanced principles of mixing and recording engineering. The workshop provides the opportunity for problem solving through the completion of short assignments and group discussion of issues related to advanced studio recording.</p>",
        "<p>During the subject students will be required to complete individual tasks and engage in whole group discussion.</p>"
