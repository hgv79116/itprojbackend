    "overview": [
        "<p>Cancer, disorders of the immune system, cardiovascular diseases and acute and chronic lung disorders are the most common types of afflictions affecting people worldwide. This subject will examine the medicines that have been developed, or are currently being researched, to treat these diverse conditions. <br/>This subject will present the scientific basis of present and likely future treatments of cancer, allergy, acute and chronic inflammation, infection, autoimmunity and transplant rejection, as well as of hypertension, heart failure, cardiovascular atheromatous disease and metabolic syndrome. <br/>You will examine current knowledge of the aetiology of these disorders. The mechanisms of action of the major classes of drugs used to treat immune disorders, cancer, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases will be considered in the context of these systems and processes.<br/>Core concepts in pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics and their importance to safe and effective therapy will be exemplified throughout. The importance of biotechnology to these therapeutic areas will also be considered.<br/><br/></p>"
