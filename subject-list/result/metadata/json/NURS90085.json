    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject provides the theoretical foundation for competent practice in paediatric critical care. Students will extend their knowledge from Applied Physiology to develop an understanding of acute and complex illnesses and diseases commonly seen in the critically ill paediatric patient. The biological basis for and evidence-based principles underpinning treatment and symptom management of common diseases and illnesses will be explored. The application of technology used in paediatric critical care will be examined. Students will gain essential knowledge to assess, plan, manage and evaluate interventions. Students will gain a deeper understanding of and integration of patient and family perspectives of illness and disease to their clinical practice.</p>"
