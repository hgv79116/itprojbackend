        "<p>This subject introduces students to the basic principles of qualitative and quantitative data analysis techniques. It will provide a functional grounding in the theoretical concepts behind each type of analysis, as well as exploration of the interpretation of data and the difference, where applicable, between clinical vs statistical significance.</p>"
