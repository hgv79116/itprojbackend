        "<p>The evolution of construction methods and the development of structural systems enable buildings to be built faster and safer than traditional construction methods. This subject introduces advanced steel and composite structures that can be used in modern construction, where most parts of a building are prefabricated off-site in a factory before assembling them on-site. The subject covers different types of structures, including steel structures, composite slabs, composite beams, composite columns, and cold-formed steel. Application of finite element analysis and design methods for modular and prefabricated buildings and steel structures under fires are also introduced to provide students with comprehensive knowledge of modern construction methods. Students will also experience design exercises of real-world structures from senior experienced practising engineers, which will place them at the forefront of both theory and practice. </p>"
