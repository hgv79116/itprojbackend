    "overview": [
        "<p>Contract interpretation is one of the most important topics in commercial law. In recent years, interpretation disputes have come to dominate contract litigation. Because views can differ as to basic questions \u2014 such as whether particular words have a plain meaning, and what \u2018commercial sense\u2019 dictates in a given situation \u2014 the outcomes of these cases can be difficult to predict. This subject will study the core principles of contract interpretation in Australian and English law. It will also examine the closely related principles concerning implied terms, rectification and estoppel by convention. Current issues and controversies will be considered. The common law approach to contract interpretation will be compared with those adopted in important international instruments such as the United Nations (UN) Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. The teacher is a former commercial practitioner who has taught contract law for many years and has published widely on relevant topics.</p>",
