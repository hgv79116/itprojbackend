    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject focuses on both the general principles of veterinary production animal practice and the specific approach to diagnosis, control and prevention of disease in production animals, with a focus on public health. Content will be delivered in blocks based on clinical presentations related to gastrointestinal, urinary, nervous and non-specific clinical problems in parallel with presentations of the same systems in other species. This approach is designed to support students in the development of their diagnostic reasoning skills, and encourage a comparative view of veterinary medicine and surgery.</p>"
