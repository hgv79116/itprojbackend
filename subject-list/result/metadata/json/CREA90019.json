        "<p><strong>This subject has been designed and developed for online delivery and assessment only.</strong></p>",
        "<p>This <em>online </em>subject provides students with the opportunity to position themselves in relation to key ideas from subjectivist and arts-based research within the creative arts therapies field. Students will learn about the most common interpretivist approaches used by researchers and explore the qualitative and arts-based methods that can be associated with each through detailed examination of specific projects.</p>",
        "<p>They will have opportunity to apply qualitative data analysis strategies in order to explore how researchers interpret data through reflexive processes. They will critically review the ways that researchers have constructed knowledge about creative arts therapies through their choices of research topics, designs and analytic procedures.</p>",
        "<p>Students will apply an understanding of reflexivity through the creation of a position statement; undertake analysis of qualitative data; critically and interpretively synthesise literature and write up results in ways that are congruent with traditions of interpretive analysis.</p>"
