        "<p>This subject develops a fundamental understanding of concepts used in the analysis, design and building of digital systems. Such systems form the information and communication technologies (ICT) that underpin modern society. This subject provides a foundation for subsequent subjects, including ELEN30013 Electronic System Implementation, ELEN90066 Embedded System Design and ELEN90061 Communication Networks.</p>",
        "<p><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT</strong></p>",
        "<p>Topics include:</p>",
        "<p>Digital systems - quantifying and encoding information, digital data processing, design process abstractions;</p>",
        "<p>Combinational logic \u2013 timing contracts, acyclic networks, switching algebra, logic synthesis;</p>",
        "<p>Sequential logic \u2013 cyclic networks and finite-state machines, metastability, microcode;</p>",
        "<p>These topics will be complemented by exposure to the hardware description language such as Verilog and the use of engineering design automation tools and configurable logic devices (e.g. FPGAs) in the laboratory.</p>",
