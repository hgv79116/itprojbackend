    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will provide a foundation in ethical, political, and economic methodologies that will be brought to bear on the analysis and evaluation of the processes and institutions that shape society. Areas of major public debate concerning justice and the distribution of resources will be examined from the perspective of philosophy, politics and economics, with experts from these fields helping to develop the skills to understand and respond to the challenges in creating a healthy, just society. In particular, we will consider the nature of justice and its relation to equality and freedom; the features and morality of a free market; how we should distribute health resources; the ethics of climate change; and what moral obligations we have to the wellbeing of those in other countries.</p>"
