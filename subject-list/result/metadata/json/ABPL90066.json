        "<p>ABPL90066 MSD Research Project Short (12.5 points) is designed to produce a 5,000-word ordered, critical exposition of knowledge gained through the student's own efforts, demonstrating a sound understanding of a topic of their choice. Regular meetings with a supervisor allow the student to obtain advice and guidance for completion of an independent study. Material prepared in any of the following subjects is expected to form an integral part of the final research report:</p>",
