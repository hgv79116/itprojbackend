    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces students to the general principles of veterinary microbiology and to the study of viral infectious agents as causes of disease in animals. It includes taxonomic and biological considerations of common and important viral pathogens, the host-pathogen interaction and the pathogenesis of disease. Key aspects of disease transmission and epidemiology are addressed, as well as methods of diagnosis of viral disease and their prevention, control and treatment.</p>"
