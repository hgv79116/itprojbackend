        "<p>Measure Theory introduces the modern conceptual framework of analysis that has led to a transformation and generalisation of such basic objects as functions, and such notions as continuity, differentiability and integrability.</p>",
        "<p>It is fundamental to many areas of mathematics and probability and has applications in other fields such as physics and economics. Students will be introduced to the core topics of Lebesgue's theory of integration, and abstract measure theory, in particular signed measures, the Hahn-Jordan decomposition, the Radon-Nikodym derivative. Additional topics may include rudiments of probability theory (conditional expectation, Borel sets and measures) and geometric analysis (rectifiable curves, Hausdorff measure and dimension).</p>"
