        "<p>Trials play an important role in the drama of public life. Their study enables a contextual exploration of how law is constructed and performed. The guiding questions of this subject are: <em>what happens in the trial? And what does the trial represent for the political community within which it takes place?</em> The subject explores these questions through a range of high profile or exemplary trials in state and commonwealth, national and international, jurisdictions.</p>",
        "<p>The key themes addressed through the in-depth study of public trials in this subject are:</p>",
        "<ul><li>The use of trials to respond to situations of injustice and social instability;</li><li>How trials generate stories of nationhood and political identity;</li><li>The role of trials in reforming law and transforming the event to which they respond; and</li><li>What the drama of the specific trial reveals about the community in which it is staged.</li></ul>",
        "<p>After introducing the nature of public trials the subject turns to a consideration of exemplary trials, both contemporary and historical, from various jurisdictions. An indicative sample may include the following famous trials.</p>",
        "<ul><li>The Eichmann Trial (Jerusalem 1961);</li><li>The Communist Party Case (Melbourne 1950-1951);</li><li>Lindy Chamberlain trials (1981-1983);</li><li>The Tampa case (Ruddock v Vardarlis, 2001);</li><li>Tasmanian Dams case, 1983;</li><li>Nulyrimma and Thompson (Australian genocide case), 1999;</li><li>Mabo (1992);</li><li>Brown v Board of Education, USA, 1954;</li><li>The David Hicks Military Commission hearing, 2007;</li><li>Kumanjayi Walker coronial inquiry and Zachary Rolfe trial, 2022; and</li><li>OJ Simpson trials (criminal and civil), 1995-2007.</li></ul>"
