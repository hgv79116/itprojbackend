    "overview": [
        "<p><strong>This subject will be delivered online in 2020 over the scheduled dates.</strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject examines current human rights issues in Asia, with particular attention to East and Southeast Asia. Human rights is a deeply contested concept, particularly in the countries of East and Southeast Asia where there is ongoing debate over which rights are to be recognised and the ways in which these rights might be given effect.</p>",
        "<p>In this subject we will investigate the way human rights issues are named, framed, and contested within \u2013 and sometimes across \u2013 Asian states. We will examine domestic institutions, rules, policies and practices concerning human rights, and investigate how rights claimants and their advocates (including lawyers and civil society groups) seek to challenge and broaden the state understandings of human rights, which often give priority to security and development. All subject materials will be in English and no knowledge of an Asian language is required, but of course students are encouraged to use non-English research materials as appropriate.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics for class discussion will include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>The ongoing debates about the meaning and scope of human rights</li><li>Domestic institutions for the promotion and protection of rights</li><li>Mobilisation for human rights: the role of civil society and the legal profession</li><li>Struggles over socio-economic rights</li><li>Environmental rights claims in developing states</li><li>Gender and sexuality rights</li><li>Expressive rights and control of the media</li><li>The contested meanings of freedom of belief</li></ul>",
        "<p>Student research papers may investigate additional or different topics.</p>"
