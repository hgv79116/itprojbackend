        "<p>*This focus, TESOL or Languages, is specific based on the course the student is enrolled in.</p>",
        "<p>It is recommended that Master of TESOL students have an English language proficiency equivalent to IELTS 7.5 (or higher) to undertake this subject, as the adult language learners in the teaching placement setting may be studying for this level. Therefore, TESOL students must be prepared for the possibility that they will be assessed on their ability to teach independently at this level.</p>"
