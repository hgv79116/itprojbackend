    "overview": [
        "<p>Students will learn how to use ultrasound to improve clinical assessment and procedures for patients in the pre-hospital setting. After completion of this subject, students will have the knowledge and skill  to perform and interpret focused clinical ultrasound to identify the cause of shock and cardiac arrest (peri-arrest), including focused ultrasound assessment of the heart, lungs, abdomen, and deep venous thrombosis (eFAST), and vascular systems and estimation of bladder volume. Students will perform, interpret, write a report and submit a log-book of 15 peri-arrest studies on simulators and/or patients with a wide range of pathology, and interpret and write a report on an additional 10 online peri-arrest ultrasound studies.</p>"
