    "overview": [
        "<p>This unit presents a series of teaching cases to immerse students in the real-world context of cybersecurity in organisations. Through the teaching cases, students will confront challenges to the management practice of cybersecurity. The teaching cases will provoke robust student-led discussions that will disentangle complex cybersecurity management concepts and instil confidence and critical thinking in students and encourage them to express their own ideas. Teaching cases have been selected to address a wide range of management challenges and expose key risks that organisations face today. These include the risks of adopting a compliance culture, fragmentation in organisational structures, poor decision-making, inadequate skills and experience, and misperceptions about the role of the cybersecurity function. </p>"
