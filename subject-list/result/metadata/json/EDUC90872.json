    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will explore the philosophical, theoretical, and practical foundations of the emerging field of The Science of Learning (with a particular focus on Educational Neuroscience). The focus of this subject will be how an understanding of the mechanisms of learning can meaningfully inform and improve pedagogical practice and learning outcomes. This subject will provide students with a broad understanding of the scientific method, the importance of neurophilosophy, an appreciation of the important brain/mind question in education, and the tenets of a successful educational philosophy. More generally, students will also learn scientific principles, and so be equipped with the skills to scientifically evaluate the validity of educational, psychological and neuroscientific arguments.<br/>Specifically, the subject will explore the following:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Essential concepts of scientific methods;</li><li>neuroimaging and brain research;</li><li>neuroscience as it applies to human learning;</li><li>neurophilosophy and the brain/mind problem;</li><li>theoretical and philosophical implications of science of learning, particularly the neuroscience of learning and teaching philosophies</li></ul>"
