        "<p>Media law is at once an established and dynamic field of law. This specialised subject provides a comparative and international law approach to media law, including international law, such as the jurisprudence of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the European Court of Human Rights and the African Court of Human and Peoples' Rights, and domestic jurisdictions including Australia, the United States of America, the United Kingdom and South Africa.</p>",
        "<p>The theoretical underpinnings of media freedom are analysed, including the definitional question of what types of speakers ought to qualify as \"media\" or a \"journalist\".</p>",
        "<p>The subject surveys the latest developments and legal protections in relation to combatting violence against journalists, focusing on the work of the High Level Panel of Legal Experts on Media Freedom.</p>",
        "<p>We also examine laws that enhance the media in its newsgathering functions, including its ability to use freedom of information laws to access government and corporate information, to rely on the principle of open justice to access and report on court cases, and to protect its confidential sources. The subject also will explore those areas that inhibit newsgathering, including surveillance of journalists, and search and seizure of journalistic material.</p>",
