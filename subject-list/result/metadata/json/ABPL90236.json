        "<p>The subject will critically explore approaches and methods in architectural design. It aims to undertake a careful, reflective engagement with a range of design approaches in architecture - from maximalist to minimalist - to examine their pros and cons, their ease of use, their outcomes and their utility and efficiency. The subject aims to assist students in developing a flexible and considered personal approach to architectural design so that they are able to judge which methods and approaches are useful in certain design circumstances.</p>"
