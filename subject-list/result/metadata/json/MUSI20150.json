        "<p>How is it that music helps you cope during difficult times? Why is music sometimes helpful and sometimes unhelpful to people? How does music work to motivate your mental health or exercise routine? How does music help people bond, bring people together or exclude people?</p>",
        "<p>Music and Health explores these questions using theory and research from a range of fields such as music studies, sociology, psychology, and medicine. This subject involves learning about the benefits and limits of music for your health and how it can be used in a range of settings to benefit the health and wellbeing of others.</p>",
        "<p>Topics covered will include music for individuals, in groups and communities. Different locations, such as hospitals, schools, community organisations, will be covered and we will consider the ways that music is best used in each of these settings. We will share case studies in which people with lived experience explain their uses of music for health and well-being.</p>",
        "<p>This subject is for students who have an interest in music, health and well-being for themselves and others.</p>",
        "<p>Students do not need to be a musician or have any experience playing an instrument or singing, although that is always welcome.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Delivery</strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject is co-delivered with MUSI10237 Music and Health, MUSI40074 Music and Health and MUSI90188 Music and Health Research.</p>"
