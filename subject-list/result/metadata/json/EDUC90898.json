    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will provide the general conceptual framework for understanding teaching and learning in early childhood. It will examine how learning can be enhanced from a range of evidence-based theoretical perspectives. Candidates will develop a range of strategies for reporting to children/students and parents/carers and develop understanding of the purpose of keeping accurate and reliable records of student achievement.</p>",
        "<p>Topics include: the clinical teaching cycle (observational assessment including making consistent judgements about learning, planning for learning, curriculum programming, implementation; critical reflection and evaluation); theories of learning; play-based learning; intentional teaching; and designing productive learning environments. These topics underpin the learning as articulated in the Early Years Learning Framework (EYLF), and the Victorian Early Years Learning and Development Framework (VEYLDF); National Quality Frameworks (NQS); The Victorian Curriculum; Australian Curriculum.</p>"
