This subject will involve a detailed analysis of how the Court interprets and applies the Rome Statute and will consider the Court\u2019s jurisdiction, structures and processes, including the initiation of formal investigations, issuance of arrest warrants, confirmation of charges, trial and appeal proceedings. The subject will also address criticisms of the Court, explain the sensitive political environment in which the Court operates and identify major challenges to the Court\u2019s efficacy. The lecturers both bring a wealth of practical experience and insight to the subject. Professor Alex Whiting from Harvard Law School was for many years the Prosecutions Co-ordinator at the ICC in The Hague, and Professor Tim McCormack is the Special Adviser on War Crimes to the Prosecutor of the ICC \u2013 a position he has held since March 2010.</p>",
