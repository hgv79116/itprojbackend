        "<p>The Robin Boyd Foundation's Walsh Street design studios explore the public role of an architect. They provide an opportunity for students to be better equipped theoretically and practically and to develop critical thinking around architectural design in an urban context and the role of good design for the community.</p>",
        "<p>The design studios are a five day residential program that involve an intensive design studio culminating in design presentations by participants with critique by the studio tutors, invited guests and project stakeholders. The project requires an architectural design response within a strong urban context on a site of high government and city importance.</p>",
        "<p>Participants will be expected to work in groups, share knowledge and participate in discussions and pin-ups - the emphasis is strongly on participation. Professional Architects from Melbourne will be invited to participate in some of the pin-ups and crits.</p>",
        "<p>Participation in the Robin Boyd Foundation's Walsh Street design studios will encourage students to consider and develop their awareness and skills in:</p>",
        "<ol><li>the public aspects of architecture - the impact of buildings on streetscapes, neighbourhoods and community;</li><li>communicating architecture - the presentation of ideas and concepts in an articulate and accessible manner;</li><li>the collaborative nature of the production of architecture.</li></ol>",
        "<p><br/></p>",
        "<p><strong>Costs:</strong> Standard course fees apply for students current enrolled in a university. Other members of the community can enrol via the Community Access Program (CAP) - only available via CAP in \u201cassessed\u201d mode.</p>",
        "<p>In addition, all students will be required to pay an additional accommodation and meals levy to the Robin Boyd Foundation.</p>"
