    "overview": [
        "<p>This 25 credit point subject is a capstone experience that will run over two consecutive terms, and will require students to integrate and apply an advanced body of knowledge and cognitive, technical and creative skills to design and complete a substantial professional project.

        "<p>Students will conduct a professional project based on a needs assessment within their professional practice context, identifying and justifying priority service areas. Selecting a priority area in collaboration with an academic and professional mentor they will design, justify and present a program, service or resource, including a business case, to address the identified area of need and design a project to meet this need.</p>",
        "<p>This subject provides the opportunity for interdisciplinary networking; dissemination of project outcomes with student peers and colleagues; and peer review prior to submission of the final assessment task.</p>",
        "<p>Further guidance for students regarding subject structure and project development:</p>",
        "<p>This capstone subject is designed to draw together the theoretical strands of the Master of Sports Medicine degree.This subject is supported by a purpose-designed online foundation module <strong>Sports Medicine LifeLong Learning and Leadership</strong>.

        "<p>Students then design and implement a project to best support the integration of their Sports Medicine career goals and the conduct of their Capstone project.</p>",
        "<p>The final <strong>Integration, Contribution &amp; Reflection Module </strong>provides opportunity for interdisciplinary networking; dissemination of project outcomes with student peers and colleagues; and peer review prior to submission of the final assessment task.</p>"
