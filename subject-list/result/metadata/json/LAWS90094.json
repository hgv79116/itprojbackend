    "overview": [
        "<p>Intellectual property (IP) occupies a central, if actively contested, place in international trade and political relations.  The COVID-19 pandemic saw widespread calls for international IP rules to be effectively suspended in the interests of global equity, while its defenders claimed the IP system was critical to a global response to the pandemic.  National security issues and the fallout from geopolitical shifts are accentuating tensions over IP, and the world's two largest trading nations, China and the United States, are seemingly at loggerheads over how effectively IP should be protected. Australia has defended its tobacco plain packaging measures over how to reconcile IP protection with the wider policy goal of public health.  Formal dispute settlement has had to address the relationship between national IP laws and measures for national security.</p>",
        "<p>Disputes over IP now seem inevitable, as the interests lying behind this once recondite, technical area come to the fore in assessments of national economic and policy interests. But will these disputes be managed within the framework of the rule of law, or does economic and political power ultimately prevail? This is not a new question. From the mid 1980s, a growing perception that inadequate or unbalanced IP protection was undercutting the economic interests of major economies made disputation about IP inevitable. The resulting tensions were a critical factor behind the inclusion of IP standards in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) system of multilateral trade law, in the form of the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement). Rather than resolving disputes over IP protection through bilateral wrangling and unilateral pressure, the rule of law would be applied in a predictable, transparent and equitable way through the multilateral dispute settlement mechanism maintained by the WTO, building on the major conventions separately administered by the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO).</p>",
        "<p>Yet TRIPS has been followed by a sharp rise in the conclusion of bilateral and regional trade and investment agreements that establish alternative or complementary sets of standards on IP and mechanisms to resolve IP disputes. The result is an intricate array of overlapping substantive standards and parallel forums for dispute settlement. And the very notion of settling disputes with reference to a stable and agreed body of law faces a direct challenge. The WTO's dispute settlement system is partially paralysed as governments, with the appeal function in suspension, as governments seek to bridge their differences over reform proposals.</p>",
        "<p>This subject enables students to navigate this complex legal landscape and to deal with its consequences from the point of view of dispute settlement practice, from the perspective of legal principle and public policy impact, and in terms of international governance and the management of trade and political relations. This will cover key international cases, strategies for treaty interpretation and approaches to reconciling IP protection with other policy imperatives and with other legal and regulatory systems. The course will examine the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and the international response to it, including proposals for a waiver of TRIPS obligations, and will address the public health dimension of dispute settlement.  We will also consider the implications of the increasing reference to national security considerations in relation to IP law and policy.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>A practical anatomy of international intellectual property conventions, standards and institutions, from the creation of the major multilateral systems within WIPO and the WTO, to the current trend towards bilateral and regional deals</li><li>The political economy of international intellectual property: the economic, political and technological factors driving disputation over IP and the creation of competing dispute settlement mechanisms, and the contemporary challenges for the continuing rule of law as the basis for containing and resolving disputes</li><li>The core principles of international IP law: IP principles and the idea of 'balance', the preservation of 'space\u2019 for domestic law and policy, the integration of trade law and public policy principles into international IP law, and integrating human rights perspectives and sustainable development goals into readings of IP conventions.</li><li>The distinctive features of international IP dispute settlement: cause of action, sources of law, remedies and challenges for treaty interpretation</li><li>Dispute settlement practice and emerging TRIPS Agreement jurisprudence under the WTO: a survey of TRIPS disputes and the use of TRIPS in cross retaliation, and a close analysis of landmark disputes, including tobacco plain packaging cases, and cases touching on national security</li><li>The implications of the WTO Ministerial Decision on TRIPS in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and of proposals for a pandemic waiver of TRIPS obligations.</li><li>The evolving architecture of bilateral and regional trade and investment agreements covering IP: the practical implications for treaty interpretation, for the initiation, management and settlement of IP disputes in multiple fora, and for domestic law and policy</li><li>Compliance and monitoring of compliance: the institutional mechanisms, and the sources of information for practitioners and government officials, for legal and policy analysts and for scholars.</li></ul>"
