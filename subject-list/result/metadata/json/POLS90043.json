    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject examines regionalism in a comparative perspective, focusing in particular on Europe and the Asia Pacific. It examines regional governance in terms of institutions, practices, values, norms and governance outputs. The role of leadership is scrutinised. The value of comparative approaches is critically examined. The subject explores theories of regionalism and comparative regionalism studies. It critically assesses The European Union\u2019s experience of regional integration and the ideas that it constitutes a template of reference point for other regions and for regionalism studies.<br/><br/>The role of sovereignty, consensus identity and security are examined in the case of Asia regionalisms. The differing emphases accorded to institutions, supranationalism, intergovernmentalism and law are examined comparatively.<br/><br/>The debates regarding what and who constitute drivers are presented in a thematic and comprehensive manner. They examine historical contexts; intellectual initiators; crisis; external threats; institutions; multilateralism; common problems; ideas and narratives all as drivers, or on occasion, as inhibitors of regionalism and integration in Asia and Europe as well as aspects of South America and Africa. This subject examines alternative views on what drives regionalism, such as multilateral forums such as the UN or the experiences and promotion of other regions \u2013 so here exogenous factors, including other regions or multilateralism or crisis or threat perception are crucial elements in this subject. Leadership and core states are also critically examined. Material, ideational and normative factors are all examined and assessed comparatively.</p>"
