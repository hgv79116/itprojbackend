    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is aimed at introducing the existing and emerging technologies used in supply chains. These technologies are sometimes general-purposed (e.g., optimization software, AI) or sometimes specific to a function in supply chains (e.g., warehouse management systems). The technologies come in both soft (e.g., software packages, blockchain) and hard (e.g., 3D printer, IoT) formats. The aim of this subject is to introduce the core functionalities and applications of these technologies in end-to-end supply chains. This subject will put more emphasis on recent technologies, including IoT, blockchain and AI and will equip the learners with the necessary skills to be able to effectively adopt such technologies in supply chains.</p>"
