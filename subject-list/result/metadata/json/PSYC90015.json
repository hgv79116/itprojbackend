    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject presents a comprehensive biopsychosocial approach to the examination and evaluation of various competing theories of aetiology; maintenance and treatment of psychological problems/disorders that commonly present to clinicians. It adopts a case-based methodology for examining how theoretical models apply to case formulation and treatment planning for different adult disorders. The conceptual strengths and weaknesses of these theoretical positions will be examined and discussed, and their empirical status will be evaluated.</p>"
