    "overview": [
        "<p>Vine to Wine begins with freshly harvested wine grapes. Students will then follow the journey through fermentation to wine in the bottle, gaining an understanding of the basic chemical and biological processes involved and the multitude of options to manipulate the process. N.B. This subject does not assume any scientific knowledge or study.</p>",
        "<p><br/>The journey is one from vine to glass. Students will cover in a hands-on way all the aspects of winemaking. This includes working fermenting wine, pressing the fermented grapes and then filtration and bottling of finished wine from the previous vintage. The subject includes an exploration of the sensory evaluation of wine and a field trip to a major winery seeing all aspects of the winemaking process.</p>",
