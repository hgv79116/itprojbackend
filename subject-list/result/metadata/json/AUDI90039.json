    "overview": [
        "<p>The final clinical practice subject will consolidate the knowledge in Speech Pathology Practice 1 and 2. The subject extends the student's experience of speech pathology clinical settings and prepares the student for independent clinical practice following graduation. The clinical placements for this subject may include hospitals, community clinics, early intervention centres, specialist centres, school, private practices, residential aged care facilities and other clinical settings. Students will be allocated to 4 week placement during semester. Students can anticipate a rural placement during this subject OR AUDI90039 Speech Pathology Practice 3. This will be at the personal expense of students.</p>",
        "<p>The student will be expected to engage with and actively participate in a variety of clinical experiences, assessing and managing a range of communication and/or swallowing disorders with infants, children, young people and adults. This subject provides the opportunity for students to develop their own personal growth and identity as a speech pathologist. Students will independently select and implement relevant diagnostic procedures and will plan and implement methods for the reduction of communication and/or swallowing difficulties during their clinical placements within this subject. To support student learning, workshops including reflective practice and discussion of clinically-relevant topics, will accompany the clinical placement experiences.</p>"
