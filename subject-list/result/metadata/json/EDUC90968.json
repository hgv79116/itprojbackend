        "<p>This subject investigates the purpose and structure of the Middle Years Programme (MYP) curriculum framework. Key issues explored will include challenges for learning and teaching in relation to: individual, community, social, global consciousness; language and inclusion; disciplinarity, interdisciplinarity, transdisciplinarity; concept-based and contextual learning and assessment. There will be a strong theoretical and critical evaluation of the development and implementation of curriculum that is intended to support both the acquisition of essential knowledge and skills, and the development of the whole person.</p>"
