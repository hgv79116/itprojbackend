        "<p>In undergraduate subjects, students are exposed to some engineering features of transport and traffic engineering. However, these do not fully provide the requisite knowledge and skills for understanding the modelling and planning aspects of transport system engineering. These competencies are of highest importance for those interested in a career in transport engineering. In this subject, students will be provided with the fundamental concept of four-step modelling in depth, including trip generation/attraction, trip distribution, modal split and traffic assignment. The contemporary topics of transport modelling such as choice modelling, car-ownership and uncertainty modelling in the context of transport infrastructure engineering will also be presented. The subject provides real world examples and assignments. The primary emphasis of the subject is on concepts (rather than mathematical details) and getting students ready for the industry.</p>"
