        "<p>Dance Lab 5 continues to develop practitioner knowledge through intensive studio-based learning that includes daily class, body conditioning and a workshop-lab.</p>",
        "<p>In this unit students develop their skills in dance practice by engaging with expressive and interpretative group tasks in relationship to music. Live, recorded and interactive music and sound, partners with dance in the studio.</p>",
        "<p>Through methods of music and sound collaboration, students learn to work with awareness and sensitivity in relationships to other dancers and performers whilst becoming more sophisticated in their rhythmic and musical knowledge.</p>",
        "<p>Technical precision, performative play and improvisational responsiveness are developed through the interplay between physical, imaginative, observation and analytical skills.</p>",
        "<p>Students develop a complementary training programme that includes aerobic/anaerobic fitness, safe dance practice and strength work. Body conditioning involves personal goal setting and self-assessment.</p>",
        "<p>Regular peer to peer sharings and tutor feedback on fitness goals ensures that progress through the term is aligned across aesthetic, somatic and embodied dimensions.</p>"
