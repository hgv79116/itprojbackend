    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject, running intensively in Week 5 of Semester 1 and delivered in Barmah (northern Victoria) , explores the idea of construction as a process linking specific principles, materials, elements, systems and techniques strategically. Using a set of individual construction types as case studies, Construction Methods A will review and explain the physical anatomy of given technological types, emphasising parameters concerned with connectedness, stability, assembly and performance. Students will learn techniques to represent these types with drawings and models.</p>",
        "<p>The subject overview and health and safety work will happen during Week 5.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Approximate costs to students:</strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject has a residential component at the University of Melbourne\u2019s Dookie campus. Students will be required to cover travel costs to and from Dookie, purchase safety equipment (work boots, hard-hats, etc.) and additional presentation materials estimated at $400 per person.</p>"
