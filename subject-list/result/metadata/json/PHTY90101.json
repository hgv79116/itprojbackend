    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will build on research knowledge from Research and Evidence 1 and integrate to apply research concepts in the individual physiotherapy clinical practice streams. Specific content in this subject will focus on exploratory and experimental research design and methodology, incorporating statistical analysis and critical appraisal. Epidemiological constructs of prevalence, incidence and risk will be introduced in conjunction with applied clinical concepts such as number needed to treat and odds ratios. Methodology relating to survey design, development and analysis will be presented. Qualitative research methodology and interpretation will be introduced, included critical appraisal. On completion of this subject, students will be able to apply all five steps in practicing evidence-based physiotherapy: (1. Convert information needs into answerable questions, 2. Track down the best evidence with which to answer those questions, 3. Critically appraise research evidence, 4. Integrate evidence with clinical expertise &amp; patient preferences and 5. Evaluate effectiveness of steps 1-4.</p>"
