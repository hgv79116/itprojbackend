    "overview": [
        "<p>Sport is renowned for embodying some of the highest and most inspiring of human ideals. Few other pursuits activate the passion with which sport is played and followed. For many people, sport delivers release from the shady aspects of life. This shining image is threatened by corrupt practices around doping, match-fixing and other activities; some with links to illegal gambling and organised crime. Also, the holding of public inquiries into questionable incidents and behaviour occurring in the context of sport can have an adverse impact.</p>",
        "<p>Sport bodies and governments around the world are taking legal and regulatory steps to counter these threats. This subject will explore the new frontier of sports law, from criminal laws to mandatory information sharing and monitoring arrangements, and onto the establishment and processes of inquiries. With an understanding of the international legal order around \u2018integrity\u2019 and sports investigations, students will be well-placed to contribute to this emerging field both practically and academically.</p>",
        "<p>Between them, the lecturers have extensive knowledge and industry experience in sports law, anti-doping, investigations and governance.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include at both national and international levels:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Nature and meaning of integrity in sports competition and governance including historical and empirical perspectives</li><li>The criminalisation of the manipulation of sporting outcomes</li><li>The legal regulation of gambling on sport and its relationship to integrity</li><li>Regulatory measures of sports bodies to address manipulation of sporting outcomes</li><li>Anti-doping rules including the World Anti-Doping Code and their status under international law</li><li>Doping and the criminal law</li><li>The structure and role of investigative and enforcement bodies such as ethics commissions and integrity units</li><li>The establishment and conduct of investigations and inquiries into sports activities and bodies including the adoption of methodologies and practices which are culturally and trauma informed</li><li>Powers of investigation and information-sharing of sports bodies and relevant government authorities with particular emphasis on doping and the manipulation of sporting outcomes and athlete abuse allegations.</li></ul>"
