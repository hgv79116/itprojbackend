    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will introduce students to a range of creative research methods. As distinct from traditional \u2018quantitative research\u2019 (classical scientific research method involving systematic collection of verifiable data) and \u2018qualitative research\u2019 (in-depth inquiry into human perceptions used in social sciences often involving interviews) \u2018creative research\u2019 is a relatively new methodology. In this subject we follow de Bono\u2019s definition that creativity involves lateral moves sideways in contrast to the logical, linear thinking inherent to traditional research methods. We follow the Oxford Dictionary\u2019s definition of \u2018research\u2019 meaning investigation or inquiry into things. The focus of our creative research will be uncovering new knowledge that can lead to the generation of imagined futures for designed environments.</p>",
        "<p>Note:<em>Students will be required to prepare installations, models, designed assemblages and drawings, as well as written essays during the course. Additional costs should be minimal. Recycling, reusing and scavenging of materials is positively encouraged. And digital presentations are allowed in lieu of costly printing for most presentations. </em></p>"
