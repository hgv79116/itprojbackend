    "overview": [
        "<p>Assessment and evaluation are critical elements of education. Formative assessments are designed to support learning while summative (high stakes) assessments are used to make judgements about an individual\u2019s success in an educational program. Both types of assessments and their application in medical and surgical education are explored in detail extending knowledge and skills covered in the core subjects.</p>",
        "<p>Evaluation is the process by which programs are judged to have been successful. Effective program evaluation begins at the planning phase of educational activities. In this subject participants will learn key skills in program evaluation adopting a traditional approach addressing program structure, process and outcomes as well as exploring links between evaluation, decision-making and action and reporting evaluation findings;. Like assessment above, this evaluation topic builds on earlier knowledge and skills of program evaluation from the core subjects.</p>",
        "<p>Although inextricable linked, assessment and evaluation have different functions.</p>",
        "<p>This subject provides the basis for detailed studies on these two critical components of curricula.</p>",
        "<p>The overall aims of the subject are:</p>",
        "<ul><li>To review the nature and purpose of assessments in professional education</li><li>To explore challenges associated with assessments in professional education</li><li>To explore the range of program evaluation methodologies</li></ul>"
