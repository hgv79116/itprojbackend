    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject explores the ways in which child welfare systems internationally have developed in response to child care and protection needs. It will consider the controversies surrounding the protection of children, and the developing knowledge base that informs responses to child maltreatment. It will explore the knowledge base underpinning child protection responses, and will explore some of the innovative frameworks, approaches and key ideas that have emerged over time. It explores some of the universal values and beliefs that underpin and drive child protection systems, particularly within Western jurisdictions, and will consider the implications of this for the development of child protection typologies that have broader international relevance.</p>"
