        "<p>This subject has two parts: design  studio and design history.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Design Studio</strong></p>",
        "<p>This foundation studio component offers an introduction to both architectural and spatial design and to the specific pedagogical and cognitive attributes of studio teaching.  The studio will provide a base for further development and exploration of diverse design processes.  The studio will introduce critique, presentation, speculation and design resolution as fundamental components of studio practice and will develop an investigative logic for design development and expression.  The studio will operate with both group exercises and individual production.  The studio will offer basic and introductory instruction in various representational, graphic and documentation techniques and processes.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Design History </strong></p>",
        "<p>This lecture and tutorial component will develop a basic understanding of how architecture acts as part of the political and cultural processes for all societies, particularly western culture. The instruction will investigate the legacy of classical western architecture and how its development is both formal and political in its consequences. It will look at the relationships of architecture to power structures and how architecture and spatial order are reflective of the social and moral relationships within a society. This non-linear history will also examine the disruptive impacts of non-western architecture and will challenge the presumptions of eternal truths and destiny for western architecture. In doing so, the course will offer a re-appraisal of architectural lineage, tradition, style and values.</p>",
