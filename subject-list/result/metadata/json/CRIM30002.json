    "overview": [
        "<p>Global Criminology examines crime and harm on a global scale. A new area of criminological inquiry, the subject focuses on phenomena that have typically gone below the criminological radar. Situating this in the context of globalisation and neoliberalism, the subject explores crimes that cross national borders, new forms of organised crime, crimes committed by nation states and new, trans-national responses to criminal conduct. Students will encounter case studies from a variety of global locations and will engage with up to the minute criminological research and theorising that attempts to understand and explain the phenomenon of global crime. On completion of the subject, students should have an understanding of how 21st century harms challenge traditional ways of thinking about crime, and ways of attempting to establish a global notion of 'justice'.</p>"
