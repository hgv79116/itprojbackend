    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will introduce basic concepts in Condensed Matter Physics, the physics of solids and liquids, from a theoretical and experimental perspective. In particular, it will address the most fundamental concepts and techniques which are required to gain a basic understanding of materials. These concepts and techniques include crystal structure, reciprocal space, adiabatic approximation, free electrons, electrons in a periodic potential, insulators, conductors, semi-conductors and mean-field theory. The subject further aims to introduce some of the most basic experimental techniques in solid state physics and material research. Finally, this subject will provide a phenomenological introduction to one of the most fascinating states of matter: superconductors.</p>"
