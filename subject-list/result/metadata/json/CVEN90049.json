    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces more advanced methods of structural analysis and design, and their applications to the engineering of reinforced concrete and structural steel in compliance with the standards. Students will be given the opportunity to integrate the use of different materials into the design of contemporary structures through design projects. This subject would typically be that final subject in the sequence of structural engineering subjects for civil engineering students who do not want to specialise in structural engineering.</p>",
        "<p>Topics covered include: structural analyses of beams and frames by the stiffness matrix method; finite element analyses; computer analysis using commercial software package; structural design of reinforced concrete beams, slabs and columns; structural design of steel beams, columns and connections; consideration of sustainability in structural design.</p>"
