    "overview": [
        "<p>The focus of this subject will be on the development of the students as confident bicultural and bilingual speakers of the Spanish language, creating short fictional texts and films at a sophisticated level of oral and written language competence. Analysing a variety of oral and written fictional narratives, with an emphasis on authentic Spanish and Latin American short stories and short films, students will identify the diversity they represent and the distinct intellectual and creative contribution of Hispanic fiction to the world based on academic research. This will allow students not only to understand the textual and cinematic structure of different genres, but also to create and reflect on their own narratives in formal (project presentation, script development) and informal contexts (discussion, short film, short story, etc.).</p>",
        "<p>Students will gain an appreciation of the cultural and historical realities that have shaped artistic expression in the Spanish and Latin American modern and contemporary worlds, recognise idiosyncratic differences within the Spanish-speaking communities and add their own intercultural contribution. They will research, reflect on, and become proficient in using complex sentence structures and verb forms and confident in communicating their own literary ideas in a range of media and fictional genres drawing on a wide variety of vocabulary, oral expressions and textual analysis skills. In addition, students will further cultivate their digital literacy and practice skills as well as a number of skills relevant to a workplace environment, such as problem-solving, teamwork, clear communication, project presentation, information literacy and professionalism.</p>",
        "<p>Part of the assessment of this subject will contribute to the ePortfolio students develop in their Spanish and Latin American Studies subjects. This digital platform offers the opportunity to showcase relevant workplace skills and digital and intercultural competencies in the target language, as well as individual interests and ideas.</p>"
