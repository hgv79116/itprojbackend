    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject extends the study of international tax from the fundamental principles covered in International Tax: Principles and Structure to a range of advanced topics affecting inbound and outbound investment by companies, other entities, and individuals.  The subject examines tax design and policy as well as the technical operation of Australian tax law.  Recurrent themes include international tax avoidance, counter-measures developed through the OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project, Australia\u2019s legislative and treaty responses to BEPS, and the counterpoint of avoiding or relieving international double taxation.  The subject includes a critical examination of the policies underlying Australia\u2019s rules and whether their technical implementation achieves their policy objectives. It also considers the ongoing reform of international tax rules, particularly through the BEPS Project.  BEPS reforms are redefining the rules for countering international tax avoidance.  This subject enables scholars and practitioners working in international tax to be aware of how international tax rules are being developed and reformed both globally and in Australia. </p>",
