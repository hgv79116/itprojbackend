    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject examines a range of positive psychological approaches that can be delivered to individuals, groups and communities across a variety of mediums. Students are introduced to the theory and research underlying different approaches, and through experiential learning approaches, beginning with self-experimentation and extending to others, students critically evaluate the contextual relevance of different approaches. A particular emphasis is given to intersections between research and practice, with implications for working with different populations, as well as novel interventions.</p>"
