    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces students to the key concepts of management. Four domains of management are explored: self, others, organisations and eco-systems. Managing self includes topics such as personal motivation, creativity and purpose. Managing others looks at working in teams, conflict, diversity and leadership. Managing organisations explores the role of firms, the creation of new businesses, the pursuit of competitive advantage, and the role of social purpose. Managing eco-systems includes topics such as value chains, innovation and stakeholder management. Students will be introduced to management theory, research and case studies that will develop their ability to manage complex real-world business problems, and to create a workplace where people can thrive.</p>"
