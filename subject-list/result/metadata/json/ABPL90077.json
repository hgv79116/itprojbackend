        "<p><strong>This subject was formerly called Transportation, Land Use and Urban Form<br/></strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject examines the linkages between transport systems and the growth and form of urban regions. It introduces the theories linking transport systems to the urban footprint, and reviews some empirical analysis of those theories. The subject also traces the evolution of theories connecting transport and land use as they have evolved over time. The timeline of this subject begins in the 1950s and extends to the present.</p>",
        "<p>This subject also introduces some of the tools used to evaluate and manage land use and transport systems, introduces strategies for integrated transport and land use planning, and examines empirical evaluations of these strategies. Major debates in the topic area are addressed. The subject develops students\u2019 ability to apply and critically analyse the theories, tools, and strategies used in transport and land use planning, and to propose alternatives and innovations to those strategies.</p>",
        "<p>This subject is taught in a seminar format. The format will include two hours of weekly guided discussion during which students are expected to have prepared to discuss several readings. There is also a one-hour lecture in which major skills-based topics are explained. These include accessibility modeling, the four-step transport model, and benefit-cost analysis.</p>"
