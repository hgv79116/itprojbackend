        "<p>In 2021, Scotland introduced the new crime of 'stirring up hatred', and the state government of Victoria, Australia was poised to expand its law against vilification (which covered only race &amp; religion) to additional protected categories of persons. Supporters see these measures as vital in tackling social inequality; opponents see them as infringing unacceptably on freedom of speech. In this course, we'll explore a range of issues in ethics and political philosophy concerning speech, connecting up with related issues in epistemology and the philosophy of language.</p>",
        "<p>Specific topics may include: the moral justification for free speech, and permissible limits to free speech; questions about what counts as hate speech; questions about what counts as (merely) harmful speech; legal questions about the regulation of speech and expression (e.g. in vilification and hate crime laws); pornography's silencing and subordination of women; online speech &amp; its restriction (including on social media platforms and in virtual game worlds); gaslighting; testimonial injustice and hermeneutical injustice; and testimony and deference in intersectional hierarchies.</p>"
