        "<p>This subject will critically examine the research evidence linking quality teaching with student outcomes within the context of contemporary educational theory, policy and practice. Of central interest will be the role of leadership, and in particular approaches to instructional leadership, in promoting, developing and providing quality teaching and student learning. Key aspects include successful change management, effective teacher professional learning and the importance of evidence and data. Candidates will conduct a self-assessment of their capabilities against the research literature on effective instructional leadership and the National Professional Standard for Principals (AITSL). This subject aligns with the Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership National Professional Standard for Principals.</p>"
