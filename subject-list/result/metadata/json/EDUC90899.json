        "<p>High quality early childhood education curricula recognise the important role played by the home numeracy environment and provide opportunities for young children to engage with mathematical concepts and to acquire mathematical language. Addressing children\u2019s numeracy skills from infancy into the early years of school, the subject is informed by the Victorian Early Years Learning and Development Framework and the Victorian Curriculum.</p>",
        "<p>Strong content knowledge supported by opportunities to rehearse mathematics teaching practice in a collaborative environment contributes to pre-service early childhood teachers\u2019 increased self-confidence. This subject will focus on both Teacher Candidates\u2019 content knowledge acquisition and their teaching practice by unpacking the strands of early childhood mathematics in lectures, and then providing opportunities in workshops for Teacher Candidates to apply academic content to a range of typical play activities.</p>",
        "<p>Topics include number, patterns and algebra, measurement, space, chance and data, contexts for 21st Century learning. The importance of providing rich mathematical encounters with children that connect to their lifeworlds will be emphasised throughout the subject.</p>"
