    "overview": [
        "<p>The rise of Asia will be a defining feature of the 21st century and holds the potential to generate a paradigm shift in how we understand public policy, administration and management. Australian policy makers are actively turning their attention to the policy, governance and practice changes required to maintain Australia\u2019s economic and political influence in the region, while broadening and strengthening relationships with Asian nations.</p>",
        "<p>This subject will provide students with the necessary foundations for creating, analysing and implementing public policy in the context of the Asian Century. In the first instance, students will consider what is meant by the Asian Century in relation to shifting economic, political and social power and what this means for international relations and governance. Students will explore what it means to be \u2018<strong>Asia capable\u2019</strong>. In particular, the subject will examine how key Asian nations view and action public policy in order to understand key differences and similarities in the way public policy is conceptualized and acted on from a Western perspective. As part of this, students will explore how key Western-style institutions, practices and orientations which comprise \u2018public administration\u2019, \u2018public management\u2019 and \u2018public governance\u2019 might be limited by or changed within the context of increasing Asian influence in the global and regional public policy sphere.</p>",
        "<p>This highly interactive subject will engage important theoretical discussions and translate key concepts into practice through the exploration of case studies from across the Asian region. Students will engage with the ongoing public debate about 'the Asian Century' to explore how it may shape the content (i.e. what does public policy include/exclude), <strong>construct</strong> (i.e. what are the differences in terms of how public policy is viewed) and <strong>conduct</strong> (i.e. how public policy is made and realised) of future public policy.</p>",
        "<p>Upon successful completion of this subject, students will be better placed to understand and engage with public policy in the context of the Asian Century.</p>"
