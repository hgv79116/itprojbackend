        "<p>The High Court\u2019s 1993 <em>Mabo</em> decision and the <em>Native Title Act 1993</em> (Cth) enable Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders to seek the recognition in Australian law of rights arising under their traditional laws and customs in respect of land or waters, as native title. Native title groups may also seek compensation in certain cases for acts that have extinguished or otherwise affected their native title.</p>",
        "<p>A determination of native title by the Federal Court requires proof of matters including the content of the relevant traditional laws and customs, the nature of the rights and interests, and the connection of the native title claim group with the land or waters by those laws and customs. Other matters to be addressed at trial include whether particular rights and interests are capable of being recognised by the common law, and whether valid laws or executive acts of the state or Commonwealth have extinguished native title such that it may not be recognised. Establishing native title also raises issues that are both theoretical and practical, such as the nature of \u2018law\u2019 and \u2018tradition\u2019, and the interaction between two systems of law.</p>",
        "<p>Once native title is recognised, or a claim is registered, native title holders must engage with other elements of Australian law including state land management and resource extraction regimes, negotiate with other land users including mining companies, make and implement agreements, and manage the proceeds of those agreements using contemporary legal tools such as companies and trusts. Native title holders must manage their recognised native title rights and interests through a corporation that holds the native title on trust for them or manages it as their agent.</p>",
        "<p>The lecturer has many years of academic scholarship in this area, engagement in law reform debates and providing practical, client-focused legal advice.</p>",
