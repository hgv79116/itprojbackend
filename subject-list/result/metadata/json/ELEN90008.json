        "<p><strong>AIMS</strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject introduces students to the fundamental principles of modern telecommunication signalling systems (SIP and XMPP and WebRTC and PSTN/Mobile) and the Telecommunication Management Network (TMN) framework. It also introduces the network numbering and addressing schemes that underpin the signalling for, and management of, telecommunications services. The Signalling component will address topics of access and core network call/session control as well as personal and terminal mobility management functions. The Network Management part will address the operation of both circuit-switched networks and TCP/IP networks including the Internet.<strong><br/><br/>INDICATIVE CONTENT<br/> </strong></p>",
        "<p>Signalling topics include:</p>",
        "<p>Principles of signalling, overview of network technologies, basic SIP signalling protocol, basic SDP usage, enhancements to SIP, basic XMPP-based JINGLE signalling protocol, introduction to WebRTC/rtcWeb features and signalling, traditional PSTN/ISDN and Mobile signalling, additional signalling services, interworking of different signalling protocols, different addressing schemes and transport of signalling in different network technologies.</p>",
        "<p>Network Management topics include:</p>",
        "<p>TMN Framework for Network Management: Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, and Security; Current Network Management in the Internet - SNMP, QoS, Net Neutrality; Ideal Performance Managment Objectives - Real-time Economic Optimisation; Emerging NM Opportunities - Management for SDN &amp; IMS.</p>"
