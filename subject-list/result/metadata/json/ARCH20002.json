    "overview": [
        "<p>Studio Gamma focuses on urban density, designing a habitable environment, dwelling space and green infrastructure. The designated site is located within the urban or inner urban area of Melbourne. The studio unfolds as an exploration of design responses to the interrelated dynamics of 21st century models of urban cohabitation, urban density, and integration of human and non-human living system in an urban setting.<br/>Underlying the undergraduate design course is the development of both design thinking and dexterity with tools and techniques. The focus of this design subject will be on generating design ideas, translating them into architectural and urban landscape forms, spaces, materials and programs. Students will learn how to refine architecture and its interaction with landscape architecture through consideration of spatial organisation, environmental context and structural necessity. Students will also learn how to communicate comprehensive architectural propositions through 2D- and 3D-modelling (physical and digital), visual and written media and oral presentations.<br/>The studio develops familiarity with, and critical awareness of, processes and modes of production that are specific to architecture and the design of urban or inner suburban landscapes. Group work comprises part of the early phases of the studio as team work is a fundamental aspect of architectural practice. Students learn to negotiate individual aspirations and design propositions with multiple partners and associates.</p>",
