        "<p>This subject focuses on the exercise and application of improvisation to theatre making processes and performance. The perception and manipulation of space, text and action will form the basis of this digital exploration of the art of generating and creating new work and performance.</p>",
        "<p>Areas covered will include spatial, physical and vocal improvisation, writing from autobiographical and other sources including found and original texts, exploring material for performance using different thematic provocations, and composing performance material via digital, audio and video media.</p>",
        "<p>Students will learn to work spontaneously and to use this spontaneity in the theatrical context in both solo and group activities. The interface between improvisation skills and their use within other fields of study and your everyday life will be explored.</p>"
