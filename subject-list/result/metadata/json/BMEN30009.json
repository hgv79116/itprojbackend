    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is designed to enable students to apply the fundamental principles of material sciences to biomedical applications. It will introduce different materials (polymers, metals, ceramics and composites) and their behaviours in contact with biological environments. In addition, students will learn about the properties of biological materials like bone, muscles, skin and vasculature.</p>"
