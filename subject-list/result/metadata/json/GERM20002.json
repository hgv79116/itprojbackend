    "overview": [
        "<p>In this subject student will further develop cultural literacy in German by engaging with the topic of \u201cWar\u201d from different perspectives with a focus on German speaking societies. Wars have shaped societies for centuries and often have long lasting effects that still influence our presence and have been a source of inspiration for writers and artists whose works are still relevant today. Students will approach the topic through different media: they will consolidate advanced reading skills by working with authentic material such as literary and journalistic texts and further improve their listening skills through the use of audiovisual and digital media. The written and oral analysis of these media will create an in-class discourse throughout the semester that allows students to further improve communicative skills in relation to contemporary and historical issues and expand students' proficiency in both written and spoken language. They will learn to use more complex grammatical structures and develop terminology typical for academic texts and discourses.</p>"
