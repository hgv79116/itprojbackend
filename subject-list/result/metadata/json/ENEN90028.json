    "overview": [
        "<p><strong>AIMS</strong><br/><br/>The subject has a strong practical component with a five-day field camp during the week before the mid-semester break involving student-led environmental monitoring. There is also a semester long project to design and implement an environmental monitoring program supported by weekly practice classes.<br/><br/>Component skills taught in this subject:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Conceptualising environmental responses</li><li>Selecting and using environmental measurement techniques (considering scale issues)</li><li>Analysis of environmental monitoring data.</li></ul>",
        "<p>This subject is a critical foundation for a career for environmental engineering but is also relevant to civil and other engineering disciplines where environmental impacts of engineering projects must be addressed to ensure sustainable engineering solutions. <br/><br/><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT</strong><br/><br/>Selection of measurement techniques and consideration of measurement scale, conceptualising environmental responses to human activities, environmental sampling and monitoring design, systematic review of causal evidence, statistical analysis of environmental effects, risk assessments for occupational health and safety during environmental field programs.</p>"
