        "<p><strong>This subject has been designed and developed for online delivery and assessment only.</strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject is focused on how to optimise one\u2019s own personal performance. It critically examines psychological, sociological and scientific research related to expertise development and examines a range of embodied, and frequently tacit, everyday practices that enable progress in all aspects of human endeavour.</p>",
        "<p>By highlighting both similarities and differences between various performance domains it aims to capture, understand, inspire and disrupt ways of thinking about one\u2019s personal performance that cut across a wide array of domains, including the arts, business, medicine and science.</p>",
        "<p>Attention is given to the various sub-skills of performance, especially the conditions that enhance expectations for future performance, influence personal autonomy, and facilitate attention focusing within various contexts.</p>",
        "<p>Students will be encouraged to implement skills and strategies within their own domain-specific learning that can help them optimise their own personal performance and development.</p>"
