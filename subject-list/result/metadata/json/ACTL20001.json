        "<p>This subject aims to provide students with basic training on modern financial mathematics methods, which covers an overview of data analysis, principles of actuarial modelling and financial transactions, the understanding of real and nominal interest rates, the time value of money methods, bond pricing methods, assets replication methods, the equation of value methods, and project appraisals methods. This subject focuses on applying the above methods to the mathematical modelling of financial markets.</p>"
