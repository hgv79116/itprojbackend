        "<p>In this subject, students will explore typical workflows of applying BIM within organisations and on projects by multidisciplinary teams. Topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Analysis of process</li><li>BIM Execution Planning</li><li>Collaborative model-sharing</li><li>BIM guidelines, standards and policies</li><li>Interoperability and \u2018Open BIM\u2019</li><li>BIM\u2019s impact on project procurement</li><li>BIM across the supply chain</li></ul>",
        "<p>As part of this analysis of the process, BIM Execution Planning and collaborative model-sharing will get explained. Also, students will learn about guidelines, standards and policies that help regulate information flow on BIM projects and they will explore how these apply in practice. As part of this topic, students will learn about the concepts behind software interoperability and information-sharing via \u2018Open BIM\u2019.</p>",
        "<p>The subject will outline BIM\u2019s impact on project procurement, both in terms of its contractual implications, as well as considering project delivery mechanisms associated with BIM. Under the \u2018whole of life\u2019 topic, students will learn to position BIM efforts by various contributors on projects across the entire supply chain, from clients, consultants, contractors, fabricators, and Facility/Asset Managers.</p>"
