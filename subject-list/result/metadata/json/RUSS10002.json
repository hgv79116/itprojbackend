    "overview": [
        "<p>The overall goal of this subject is to help students develop cultural and linguistic knowledge that allows them to feel comfortable thinking of themselves as users of Russian, in listening, reading, writing and speaking. It introduces students to cultural notions of time and space as they play themselves out in such topics and notions as referring to activities and events (in present and past story-telling), occupations and pastimes (school, work, and free time), and the world around us (environment, residence, etc.). Comparisons to current Russian life and society build the foundation for cultural literacy and familiarity with the Russian-speaking world.</p>"
