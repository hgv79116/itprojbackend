    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject elaborates on the scientific basis of disease recognition in individual animals and populations of animals. It explores causes of disease in animal populations, the mechanisms of disease processes and their transmission, principles of biosecurity, and the scientific basis of technologies and procedures available for monitoring disease status (diagnostics). Students will acquire skills in a variety of techniques used to monitor the health of populations of animals (ELISA, PCR, microbiology), and will develop abilities in critical analysis of animal health related matters.</p>"
