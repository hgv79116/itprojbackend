    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject together with EDUC90845 Learning Intervention 2 the compulsory [AQF] Capstone experience for Stream A of the Master of Learning Intervention (MLI) course encompassing the three separate specialties of Deaf Education (DE) Learning Difficulties (LD) and Disability (D).</p>",
        "<p>The subject will deepen students\u2019 knowledge of educational research and their ability to apply theory to practice. Through collaborative workshops, students will explore collecting and analysing student data, utilising evidence-based research to inform intervention and reporting findings. Through the evaluation of the evidence-base of different educational practices (REP), identification of ethical issues with practitioner research, and reflection on learnings from Learning Intervention 1, students will refine and further advance their capacity to improve educational outcomes for students with disabilities, specific learning difficulties or hearing loss.</p>",
        "<p>Students will apply their learnings when undertaking their second 15 day practicum placement in an educational setting that includes learners with disability, learning difficulties or hearing loss. They will then engage in directed observation and interaction with learners, refining skills in planning, implementing and evaluating educational interventions.</p>",
        "<p>Students will produce an extensive case study and intervention plan developed after a continuous process of assessment, data collection, intervention and evaluation, with a learner with disability, learning difficulties or hearing loss in areas such as language, literacy, numeracy, mental health/well-being, thinking and learning, exceptionality, behaviour and/or audiology.</p>",
        "<p>Students will produce a capstone report in the style of a journal article reflecting on their development as an evidence-based practitioner.</p>",
        "<p>Please note: DE Students who do not have competence in Auslan are expected to successfully complete Module 1 of Auslan Certificate 2 (or equivalent) prior to taking this subject. Auslan courses are offered at a number of TAFE colleges (or equivalent) nationally.</p>"
