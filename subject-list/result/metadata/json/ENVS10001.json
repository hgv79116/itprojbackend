    "overview": [
        "<p>The subject introduces students to the elements of natural systems that underpin Agricultural production and Natural Resource Management (NRM). A critical understanding of these elements and systems is fundamental for the sustainable management of our natural resources. The subject will demonstrate how science can be applied to evaluate and manage ecosystems, and to maintain and improve the sustainability of land resource-based industries. Major themes explored include earth processes and materials; landscape processes and soil formation; weather, climate and climate change; microclimate; nutrient cycling in terrestrial systems; the water cycle and catchment hydrology and; agroecosystems. Indigenous perspectives on natural systems are also considered. Practical skills in landscape assessment and interpretation are emphasised, as well as an appreciation of the effects of scale and temporal change in the examination of natural and managed systems.</p>"
