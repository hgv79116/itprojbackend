    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will introduce the general principles and modern methods of plant evolutionary biology: how to discover the phylogeny (relationships) of organisms using both morphological characters and molecular (DNA) data; how to use this information to improve the classification systems of plants; how to study aspects of evolution, coevolution and historical biogeography; and how to integrate information from living and fossil plants to discover the past and date evolutionary events. Examples of the diversity and evolution of Australian plants - both fossil and living forms - will be used throughout this subject. Topics will include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>discovering plant relationships phylogenetic systematics;</li><li>evolution of vascular plants, especially flowering plants;</li><li>fossil history of land plants;</li><li>historical biogeography and evolution of Australian flora.</li></ul>"
