    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject builds on the current philosophical and ethical approaches and the materials and techniques used in conservation interventions of cultural collections. Students learn to document the condition and materials of collections, to examine the value-based frameworks for the development of decisions and apply these in conservation actions. Students develop and carry out minor conservation actions on selected collections that are ethical, sustainable and achievable.</p>",
        "<p>This unit may include laboratory or field work in situ as an individual or group projects.</p>",
        "<p>During the pre-teaching period, students are encouraged to participate in a 1-hour orientation forum, engage with the online lectures, complete the course readings and any other course preparation as outlined in the LMS. The LMS will be available at the commencement of the pre-teaching period.</p>"
