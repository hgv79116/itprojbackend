        "<p>This subject will examine the ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) of genetics and genomics. It will be organised into 3 overarching topics:</p>",
        "<ul><li>The principles of ethical and legal frameworks will be introduced, and will be applied in the context of genomics in healthcare practice, with consideration of professional and personal values.</li><li>The foundations of public health will be introduced and applied to public health genomics programs, particularly genetic screening.</li><li>Personal genomic testing will be discussed from multiple perspectives, including historical, ethical, regulatory and social.  How genetics is communicated and genetic literacy in the community will be explored.</li></ul>"
