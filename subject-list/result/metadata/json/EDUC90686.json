    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will support students to become literacy leaders in schools or other educational organisations. It will explore and critique the forms of literacy that are typically valued by schools, systems and the community, and why this might be the case. What counts as an evidence base for informed practice will also be a central focus. The application and appropriateness of different assessment and evaluation frameworks will be examined, alongside notions of authentic and ethical assessment. Students will work with a range of data (from large data sets and standardised measures to those gathered using ethnographic approaches to literacy practices) with a view to developing expertise and confidence in whole school and classroom action planning for informed and interventionist approaches to literacy teaching.</p>"
