    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will examine and focus on modern Israeli history, beginning with the first decade of Israeli statehood and evaluating the nation-building process, the formation of state institutions and the evolution of a democratic regime. Also discussed will be the disparity that became evident between the Zionist ideal and the difficulties of this realization as long-standing divisions emerged such as the Ashkenazi-Sephardic dispute, ultra-orthodox-secular split and Arab-Israeli tensions.</p>",
        "<p>The subject will also investigate the revisionist, post-Zionist and other critiques that have to come to the fore in Israeli society over the last two decades. It will engage a number of significant Jewish thinkers and their critical and theoretical reflections on present and future perspectives. The readings include a rich and diverse mix of documents: primary sources, scholarly articles, short stories, poetry newspaper and magazine articles, films and music, all marshalled to illustrate crucial events and change in Israeli history. These sources not only demonstrate the complexity and multiplicity of Israeli history, but will also enable students to cultivate their skills at hands-on historical analysis.</p>"
