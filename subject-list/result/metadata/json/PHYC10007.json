    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will develop students' appreciation of the importance of physical principles to biomedicine as well as their understanding of the principles underpinning human structure and function, medical diagnostics and therapeutics. Lectures for this subject contain an extensive range of live in-lecture demonstrations where many of the topics are demonstrated with experiments using apparatus from the School of Physics collection.</p>",
        "<p>Physics for Biomedicine provides the fundamental physics concepts required to understand many biological and medical applications. By taking this subject you will study the mechanics behind the movement of the human body, the physical principles of various human systems and the biophysics that underpin cell biology. You will also learn concepts central to medical imaging and diagnostics. Physics for Biomedicine will help you develop your problem solving and laboratory skills in the context of the medical applications of physics.</p>"
