        "<p>This is the second of a sequence of two subjects (Foundation Mathematics 1 and Foundation Mathematics 2) providing BSc (Ext) students with a foundation in mathematics that prepares students for the Bachelor of Science or a pathway into the Bachelor of Commerce. The content consists of traditional VCE mathematical topics, with a particular emphasis on those topics needed for subsequent studies in the Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Commerce degree. Applications, examples and problems will be taken from these disciplines.</p>"
