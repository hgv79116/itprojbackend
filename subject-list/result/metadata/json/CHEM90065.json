    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject will discuss the theory of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, relevant experimental techniques and its application in molecular structure determination. The theory of pulse Fourier Transform NMR will be presented along with the methods of spectral processing. Key aspects of proton chemical shift, spin-spin coupling and coupling constants will be discussed. <sup>13</sup>C and heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy as well as the theory and application of advanced 2D techniques will also be detailed. A combination of 1D and 2D methods will be applied to determine the structure of complex molecules.</p>"
