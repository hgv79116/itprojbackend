    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject involves the definition and development of an internship placement in collaboration with the host institution. It has at its core a workplace project that will allow students to develop skills in project management, problem solving, multi-disciplinary workplace practice, institutional policy and strategy mapping, project reporting and communication.</p>",
        "<p>This internship subject aims to provide students with a high-level employment experience with government, industry or non-government organisation (NGO). Students will develop a good understanding of potential employer expectations of Masters graduates and the skills required to function and excel in a workplace involved in the application of scientific research, technology, policy, planning or management.</p>",
        "<p>With assistance from the subject coordinator, students will be required to source a host-institution and develop a workplace project in consultation with (a) representative(s) from the host institution. More information is available on the subject webpage here: <a href=\"https://science.unimelb.edu.au/study/internship-subjects\">https://science.unimelb.edu.au/study/internship-subjects</a>. The student and academic supervisor then define and coordinate the internship placement and develop a workplace project in consultation with (a) representative(s) from the host institution. </p>",
        "<p>Application for credit needs to be submitted via the <a href=\"https://industry.science.unimelb.edu.au/index.php?r=studentRequest/create\">Internships Portal</a> at least 3 weeks prior to internship commencement and within the <a href=\"https://science.unimelb.edu.au/study/internship-subjects\">Key Dates</a> mentioned on the website. However, students undertaking the Ecosystem Internship subject may have some additional flexibility for placements that extend beyond these dates. However, applications must be submitted before the application deadline. More information is available on the subject webpage here: <a href=\"https://science.unimelb.edu.au/students/plan-your-study/internship-subjects\">https://science.unimelb.edu.au/students/plan-your-study/internship-subjects</a>.

        "<p>This project may relate to an applied science, technological, economic, social or management topic. Each student will prepare an \u2018Internship Plan\u2019 which includes relevant information about the project\u2019s aims, context in relation to the institution, approaches to be used, relevant background knowledge and potential outputs to the host-institution. Students will then spend a period of 4-5 weeks (full-time equivalent; ca. 200 hours) working within their host institution i) gaining experience, ii) shadowing institution mentors and iii) working on their internship project. At completion of the internship placement, students will be required to present their findings to an audience, including members of the host-institution, in form of an \u2018Internship Seminar\u2019, and submit a \u2018Main Report\u2019 on their internship project.</p>"
