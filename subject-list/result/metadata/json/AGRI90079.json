        "<p>The work will include a project proposal, researching an area of importance to an Agricultural industry. This will include a brief review of the body of scientific literature to provide context and rationale, together with an approach or protocol for a modest original experiment, or a limited exploration of a scientific problem. The proposal is a hurdle requirement and a pass (30% or more) is required to continue with this subject. Final reports and oral presentations will occur at the end of semester and orals will involve a mini-symposium where findings will be presented to project stakeholders and the student cohort.</p>",
        "<p>Projects may involve regular 1-hour discussion groups where students report on progress, any problems and ongoing plans.</p>"
