Topics covered include: capital formation; role of interest rates; assessing financial feasibility and the investment decision; project financing and financing instruments; technological strategies; profitability; socio-economic impact of projects; cost-benefit analysis; fitness for purpose; and revision of forecasts and financial decisions during project implementation. Students are required to apply this knowledge to real-life case projects to develop appropriate models for the analysis and evaluation of how the work meets objectives and expectations of the parties involved.</p>",
