    "overview": [
        "<p>In this subject students participate in an individual program of supervised research within the School of Biomedical Sciences, or elsewhere within the faculty, at a research institute or overseas institution in which the student contributes to the design of a research project, in consultation with a supervisor\u037e conducts the research\u037e and presents the findings of the project. The project may be self contained or form a component of a larger research program. Each student will receive feedback on their progress through ongoing consultation with their supervisor.</p>",
        "<p>Where a student is conducting the research external to the School of Biomedical Sciences, a School of Biomedical Sciences academic staff member who has allied research expertise co-supervises the project and coordinates the assessment requirements. Detailed assessment requirements, including due dates of individual assessment items, are determined through consultation between the supervisor, the co-supervisor and the Biomedical Science Research Project Coordinator(s) in the relevant department.</p>",
        "<p>The subject may incur additional costs such as travel and accommodation. Students may be eligible for University funding. Where the host institution is located in the IndoPacific, Australian citizens for whom this subject is part of a full time semester of study may consider applications through the New Colombo Plan scholarship funding.</p>"
