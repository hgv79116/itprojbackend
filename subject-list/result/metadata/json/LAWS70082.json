    "overview": [
        "<p>Privacy has been valued for centuries but now there is a resurgent interest in its protection as a result of new technologies, changing social norms and a rise of markets focused on the commodity value of information. Overlapping with the resurgent interest in privacy is a related concern about the management of data flows, especially on the part of government agencies and business organisations. The legal frameworks that deal with privacy and data protection have a long history but are coming under pressure to adapt to a more complex modern environment.</p>",
        "<p>In this subject, you will pay particular attention to the scope and nature of privacy protection as well as appropriate limits and exceptions, the ongoing pressures for law reform, and the practical operation of privacy and data protection laws in Australia and comparable jurisdictions.</p>",
        "<p>Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>What is privacy?</li><li>Conceptual and legal definitional issues</li><li>International and comparative privacy and data protection regimes</li><li>Protection of privacy in general law in Australia and comparable jurisdictions</li><li>The <em>Privacy Act 1988</em> (Cth): regulation of personal information held by the private and public sectors</li><li>State/territory (especially Victorian) legislative regimes for the regulation of personal information</li><li>Current topics in privacy law such as privacy and the media, privacy and health information, online privacy, telecommunications and surveillance privacy</li><li>Current reform inquiries and proposals and likely reforms.</li></ul>"
