    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject introduces students to the theory and practice of teaching Languages to young learners within early childhood settings. Beginning with a theoretical foundation based on contemporary research in second language education, the fundamental question of how languages are taught will be introduced and discussed within a communicative framework for language teaching and learning, in alignment with the Victorian Early Years Learning and Development Framework (VEYLDF). The subject then focuses on practical implications related to integrating language learning and intercultural understanding within play-based pedagogies. This subject also includes a focus on language ecologies in early childhood settings, the nature of language, multimodal engagement with language and culture, the role of the planning and reporting cycle and the role of community in language programs.</p>"
