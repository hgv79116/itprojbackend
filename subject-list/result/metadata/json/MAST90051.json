        "<p>Mathematical modelling of various types of risk has become an important component of the modern financial industry. The subject discusses the key aspects of the mathematics of market risk. Main concepts include loss distributions, risk and dependence measures, copulas, risk aggregation and allocation principles, elements of extreme value theory. The main theme is the need to satisfactorily address extreme outcomes and the dependence of key risk drivers.</p>"
