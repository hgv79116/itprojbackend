    "overview": [
        "<p>As the print publishing market in all its forms adapts to the impact of new technologies, this subject examines the resulting seismic changes, the impact of digital technologies on the publishing supply chain and the shifting strategic contribution of marketing to the publishing process. We study the changing structure of the market, including analysis of the changing role of publishers, wholesalers, bricks and mortar retailers (both specialist and non-specialist) and online providers on the supply side; and examine demographic, cultural and social factors influencing the structure of demand. We explore factors affecting the competitive environment, including the impact of digital technologies on the print supply chain and the interaction between old and new media. We use case studies to highlight the issues of market segmentation, branding and product placement. Assessment tasks focus on researching specific market segments and developing practical, commercially astute marketing strategies.</p>"
