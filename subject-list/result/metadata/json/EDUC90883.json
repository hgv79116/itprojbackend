        "<p>This subject builds on the skills and knowledge developed in EDUC90373 Primary Humanities Education. This subject aims to explore how the Humanities curriculum can be designed to help students understand the world around them. Emphasis will be placed on effective teaching and learning practices in the Humanities, with a particular focus on inquiry, digital and design technologies, student agency, questioning, critical thinking, authentic problem solving and communication strategies. Teacher Candidates will apply their understanding of these processes in a critical inquiry-based project focusing on Geography, History, Economics and Business, and Civics and Citizenship. The development of an inquiry-based unit aims to encourage young learners to explore and clarify values and attitudes, and to develop relevant knowledge and skills to understand their world. Through the inquiry process, opportunities for active and informed citizenship for the 21st century will be explored.</p>"
