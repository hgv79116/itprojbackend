    "overview": [
        "<p>Contract is central to the legal regulation of most commercial and economic activity, and underlies many specialist areas of legal practice. As market costs and values move, many contracts become increasingly valuable to one party and burdensome to the other. One party\u2019s ability to terminate, or to successfully resist the termination of, a commercial contract is frequently a matter of considerable financial importance. The complex interaction between common law termination rights and rights to terminate expressly conferred by clauses in the contract in question is seldom properly understood, as illustrated by many of the cases from which this subject is taught.</p>",
        "<p>This subject is taught from selected cases rather than textbooks. Principal topics include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Breach of conditions, including what makes a promissory term a strict condition</li><li>Non-fulfilment of conditions precedent, and associated promissory obligations</li><li>Breaches of intermediate terms, and what makes them sufficiently serious to justify termination</li><li>Repudiation in its different forms</li><li>Breach of time obligations, and the use and consequences of Notices to Perform/Complete</li><li>Express termination clauses\u2014the different principles concerning their operation, and \u2018compare and contrast\u2019 the principles concerning termination at common law</li><li>Possible limits on an aggrieved party\u2019s right to terminate through:<ul><li>Election/affirmation</li><li>Estoppel</li><li>Breach or an absence of readiness, willingness and ability to perform on his/her own part</li><li>Relief against forfeiture</li></ul></li><li>Remedies accompanying effective or attempted terminations, including:<ul><li>Principles of quantifying expectation damages at common law</li><li>Limited rights to damages on termination pursuant to an express clause</li><li>Contractual rights to remuneration accrued due prior to the termination</li><li>Exceptional limitations on the recoverability of contractual remuneration.</li></ul></li></ul>"
