        "<p>This capstone project will provide the culmination of the Master of Data Science degree. It will apply the skills developed during the degree to a practical problem of relevance to science, industry, commerce or society in general. Students will continue to work in their teams established in MAST90106 Data Science Project Part 1, again under only general guidance from staff members. They are expected to present technically correct results in a fashion acceptable to industry-based and other clients.<br/>Students will be continue to be expected to complete diaries to log their work on the project so that the extent of their contribution to group projects can be determined. In this part of the project students will complete the project and present a group project report and oral presentation.</p>"
