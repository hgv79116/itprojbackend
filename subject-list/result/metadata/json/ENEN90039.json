    "overview": [
        "<p>In this subject, students will learn to solve practical hydrological problems by using the latest research results and the latest research and industry tools. Learning will be student-led and project-based, supported by teaching staff members. Students will learn to scope projects, develop methods, collate data, conduct analyses, write up and present project reports. Each student will work on three projects. <br/>Project modules will vary from year to year. Example modules are design flood modelling, groundwater modelling, hydrodynamic modelling, rainfall-runoff modelling, river system modelling.</p>"
