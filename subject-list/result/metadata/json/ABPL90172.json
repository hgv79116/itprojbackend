        "<p>A studio-based subject that offers speculative investigations for landscape architectural design. Building upon landscape derived theoretical influences and precedent informed by design practice, Studio options will vary from year to year. Framed by contemporary agendas for landscape design, studio investigations will include speculation and experiment with spatial design, materiality and detailing; digital media; heritage and conservation in national and or international contexts.</p>",
