In the first part we discuss combustion fundamentals, including thermodynamics, chemical kinetics, conservation equations, and application of these principles to solve simple flames and reacting flows. In the second part we discuss combustion engines and the combustion phenomena in spark-ignition and compression-ignition engines.</p>",
