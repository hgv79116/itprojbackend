        "<p><strong>AIMS</strong></p>",
        "<p>This subject provides an introduction to modern control theory with a particular focus on design of advanced control laws via state-space methods and optimal control. The role of feedback in control design will be reinforced within this context, alongside the role of optimisation techniques in control system synthesis. <br/><br/><strong>INDICATIVE CONTENT</strong></p>",
        "<p>Topics include:<br/>State-space models - first-order vector differential/difference equations; Lyapunov stability; linearisation; discretisation; Kalman decomposition (observable, detectable, reachable and stabilisable subspaces); state-feedback and pole placement; output-feedback and observer design in both continuous-time and discrete-time.<br/>Optimal control - dynamic programming; linear quadratic regulation in both continuous-time and discrete-time. Model predictive control in discrete-time; moving-horizon with constraints.</p>"
