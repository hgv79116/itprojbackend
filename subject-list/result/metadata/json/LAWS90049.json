    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject focuses on the reimagination of human rights from a gender and women\u2019s rights perspective. The traditional human rights canon has been challenged in important ways by its deficiencies in the protection of the rights of women and sexual and gender minorities. The primary focus on violations by state actors was shown to obscure and make invisible violations against women in the private sphere of family and home, in particular gender-based violence. The partial and contingent protection of sexual and reproductive rights under international human rights law has revealed persistent gendered limitations. Meanwhile, the adherence to date of international human rights law to the male/female binary has proven exclusionary to the promotion and protection of the rights of sexual and gender minorities.  </p>",
        "<p>This subject considers these critiques and examines their explanatory force. It considers ways in which the international human rights system has responded to critiques and demands of feminist and gender scholars and activists. The subject will focus, first, on the international system for the protection of women\u2019s rights, in terms both of \u2018mainstream\u2019 guarantees of non-discrimination and the specialised system for the protection of women\u2019s rights, most notably CEDAW. Second, the subject will focus on certain emblematic violations of women\u2019s and gender rights (gender-based violence, reproductive rights and the rights of sexual and gender minorities) and critically examine developments in the recognition and redress of such violations under international human rights law. Third, the subject will consider the relationship between the formal mechanisms of the human rights system and the mobilisation of human rights ideas and values by social movements and non-governmental organisation. It will consider, in particular, the role and value of international human rights norms in underpinning diverse social movements working in alliance for the improved protection of women\u2019s and gender rights.</p>",
