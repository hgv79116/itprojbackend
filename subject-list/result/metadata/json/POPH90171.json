    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject enables students to explore contemporary substance use (alcohol and other drug use) among young people. This will include building an understanding of current frameworks/policies for responding to the complex issue of substance use among young people. Current trends in substance use among young people, drawing on contemporary literature from Australian and international contexts will be explored across the spectrum of prevention through to substance abuse treatment. The role of social culture and the media will be examined. Students will draw on a diversity of current research to tease out some of the key risk and protective factors for adolescent substance use. Students will also explore current frameworks to assist young people engaging in substance use to avoid harm and initiate and maintain change (e.g., harm minimisation, stages of change and relapse prevention models, strengths-based approaches, trauma informed practice).</p>"
