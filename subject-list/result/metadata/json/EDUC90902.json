    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is for all Teacher Candidates in the Master of Teaching Secondary. In this subject Teacher Candidates will explore research, theories and strategies that are useful for examining diversity and inclusion in Australian school classrooms. Teacher Candidates will investigate ways in which schools reinforce and/or challenge the social norms inherent within. Furthermore, candidates will gain knowledge and understanding of physical, social and intellectual development and characteristics of students and how they affect learning. Furthermore, this subject will explore teaching strategies that are responsive to the learning strengths and needs of students from diverse linguistic and religious background.</p>",
        "<p>The subject will also examine the school and the classroom itself with their own dominant systems of values, ideologies and differing relationships of power and authority. Inter-personal relationships in schools and classrooms and with communities will also be examined and will identify the types of interactions that occur as well as what opportunities for learning and development arise. As part of this subject teacher candidates will understand strategies for working effectively, sensitively and confidentially with parents/carers.</p>"
