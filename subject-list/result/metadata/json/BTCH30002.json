        "<p>Students will acquire knowledge of the recent and important developments in biotechnology related to agriculture and food and develop an understanding of local and global issues in biotechnology in relation to environment health and sustainable crop and animal production. This subject will provide an overview of the integrated use of various biological technologies for the effective translation of novel research into agri-food related applications including steps involved in commercialisation of agri-food biotechnology-related products and services and international trade and related economic issues. The students will also develop understanding of contemporary social and economic issues arising due to adoption of biotechnology in the agri-food sector.</p>"
