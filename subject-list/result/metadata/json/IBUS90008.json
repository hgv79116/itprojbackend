    "overview": [
        "<p>Many of the products and services consumed in Australia and around the world are designed, manufactured and delivered via interdependent global value chains. Therefore, success of firms depends on their ability to manage these value chains dispersed across the world. This subject will discuss global value chains, their functioning, the challenges they face, and the strategies to manage them. Particularly, the subject will analyse the sociopolitical and economic conditions giving rise to global value chains, their governance and management, risks posed by them and the strategies to manage them, sustainability challenges in them, and their future.</p>"
