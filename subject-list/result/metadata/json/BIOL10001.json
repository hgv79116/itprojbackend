This will include Australia's familiar and our more elusive inhabitants - from eucalypts and kangaroos to velvet worms and orchids.\u202fThroughout, you will learn of the conservation successes and failures and how we protect our precious flora and fauna for the future. This subject will require you to observe,\u202frecord,\u202fand reflect on the\u202fdiversity of the\u202fnatural world, and complete self-guided field trips with your peers within the Melbourne\u202fmetropolitan region.\u202f\u202f </p>"
