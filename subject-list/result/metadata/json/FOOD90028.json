    "overview": [
        "<p>Sensory evaluation is a scientific method used to evoke, measure, analyse, and interpret those responses to food products as perceived through the sense of sight, smell, touch, taste and hearing. Sensory evaluation guides development and commercial strategy within the food industry. It plays a critical role steering decisions throughout the product development process, in food formulation, in quality control of food products, and in the innovation of healthier food products with improved taste. It can also provide vital insights into fundamental human behaviour and perception. Sensory evaluation can be broken down into four major methods which will be covered in detail in this subject: Trained panel testing, discrimination testing, rapid profiling, and consumer testing. The subject will also examine how sensory perception is influenced by both physiological and psychological factors. Furthermore, the subject will address how food scientists can use techniques in food formulation to optimise the sensory properties of food, and how different forms of sensory data can be processed to draw appropriate conclusions (including statistical tools for sensory analysis). The subject is supported by practical laboratories.</p>"
