    "overview": [
        "<p>This subject is concerned with the application of law to 'cyberspace' - i.e. to the virtual environment created by the Internet. It considers two major objectives of laws in cyberspace: regulation and proprietisation. The regulation theme focuses on governance of the Internet's technical architecture, and on public and private control of content on the Internet. The proprietisation theme focuses on the ownership of Internet addressing means, and on the protection of commercial reputation and creative material on the Internet.<br/><br/>The principal topics covered in this subject are:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Cyberspace and the Internet;</li><li>Jurisdiction in cyberspace;</li><li>Censorship in cyberspace;</li><li>Privacy in cyberspace;</li><li>Trade marks in cyberspace;</li><li>Cybersquatting;</li><li>Copyright in cyberspace;</li><li>Copyright liability of Internet intermediaries; and</li><li>Virtual worlds.</li></ul>"
