        "<p>The goal of the course is to develop familiarity with the requirements and methods of downstream processing, i.e., separation, purification and formulation, in biotechnological applications, particularly for biopharmaceutical production. The course will introduce general principles of downstream processing but most of the semester will be devoted to the treatment of the most important unit operations employed in downstream processing. As is typical for chemical engineering courses, this one will include elements of both analysis and synthesis (i.e., design). Although the modern industry depended extensively on empiricism over much of its first few decades, there is increasing interest in and use of a deeper fundamental understanding of individual unit operations, including use of detailed computer simulations. The emphasis in the course will be on such a fundamental treatment of the various operations that we will encounter and will include use of computational models. References to relevant published research articles will also be provided.</p>",
